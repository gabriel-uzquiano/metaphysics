    "section": "1.2 The A-Theory and the B-Theory of Time",
    "text": "1.2 The A-Theory and the B-Theory of Time\nMcTaggart’s argument is valid, which means that we must either reject at least one premise or else embrace the unreality of time. Two approaches to the metaphysics of time arise in line with the rejection of each premise of the argument. A-theorists tend to reject M2, whereas B-theorists reject M1.\n\n1.2.1 The A-Theory of Time\nThe A-theoretic picture of time maintains that there is an A-series of moments of time, which are subject to change from future to present to past. That means that they reject M2. To that purpose, they must respond to the argument McTaggart offers in support of that premise.\nMcTaggart is aware that the premise that moments are future, present, and past may seem doubtful when we switch to a tensed formulation of the relevant predications:\n\n\n\nm\nis future\nhas been future\n\n\nm\nis present\nis now present\n\n\nm\nis past\nwill be past\n\n\n\nMcTaggart replies that this is a distinction without a difference, since there is a simple paraphrase for each tensed predication.\n\n\n\nm\nhas been future\nis future at some past moment\n\n\nm\nis now present\nis present at some present moment\n\n\nm\nwill be past\nis past at some future moment\n\n\n\nThe issue now is that to the extent to which the relevant moments of time are part of an A-series, they each are future present and past, which is, for McTaggart, incoherent.\n\n1.2.1.1 An Infinite Regress?\nWe may insist that talk of a past moment is talk of a moment that has been present, talk of a present moment is talk of a moment that is now present, and talk of a future moment is talk of a moment that will be present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm\nis future at some past moment\nis future at some moment that has been present\n\n\nm\nis present at some present moment\nis present at some moment that is now present\n\n\nm\nis past at some future moment\nis past at some moment that will be present\n\n\n\nMcTaggart’s response is to insist that talk of a moment that has been present is talk of a moment that is present at some past time in which case we have just posponed the problem. In fact, we could iterate the process ad infinitum, which, for McTaggart, is by itself a reason to reject the existence of an A-series in the first place.\n\n\n1.2.1.2 How to Take Tense Seriously\nIn response to McTaggart, C. D. Broad draws a helpful distinction in (Broad 1934) between two styles of predication:\n\nTwo Styles of Predication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTenseless Predication\nTensed Predication\n\n\n\n\nTwo is even\nTwo is now my favorite number\n\n\n\nTwo has been my favorite number\n\n\n\nTwo will be my favorite number\n\n\nThe lecture is part of a colloquium\nThe lecture is now underway\n\n\n\nThe lecture has been underway\n\n\n\nThe lecture will be underway\n\n\n\nOne important difference between the two uses of the expression ‘is’ is that the statements in which it occurs as a tensed copula are often only temporarily true, whereas the statements in which it occurs as a tenseless predicate are sometimes permanently true. To disambiguate, we may use capital letters when we mean the predication to be tenseless.\nNow, McTaggart’s infinite regress arises only when one insists on an analysis of tense in terms of tenseless predication. In McTaggart’s case the proposed analysis takes the form:\n\nMcTaggart’s Reduction of Tense\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTensed Predication\nTenseless Predication\n\n\n\n\n\\(m\\) has been \\(F\\)\n\\(m\\) IS \\(F\\) at some moment \\(m'\\), which IS past.\n\n\n\\(m\\) is now \\(F\\)\n\\(m\\) IS \\(F\\) at some moment \\(m'\\), which IS present.\n\n\n\\(m\\) will be \\(F\\)\n\\(m\\) IS \\(F\\) at some moment \\(m'\\), which IS future.\n\n\n\nBroad agrees that given the proposed analysis, we are led into an infinite regress. But we should simply reject McTaggart’s invitation to paraphrase the tense in the way he suggests. The proper conclusion from McTaggart’s argument is that tensed predication is irreducible and cannot be analyzed in terms of tenseless predication.\n\\(A\\)-theorists of time tend to take tense seriously much like C. D. Broad recommended in response to McTaggart. They take the B-series to leave something out, namely, which time is now, which times are past, and which times are future. As (Zimmerman 2005) puts the point in p. 431:\n\nThe essence of the A-theory is the objectivity of the distinction between past, present, and future. What is presently true is true, simpliciter, not merely true relative to a time or utterance or situation.\n\nOf course B-theorists understand now differently. They take the word ‘now’ to act as an indexical for the moment of utterance. That is, the word ‘now’ picks out different times for different utterances of the sentence ‘I’m now in Peru’ at different times. But that is one reason why the A-theorist will reject the B-theorist attempt to translate ‘m is past’ in terms of ‘earlier than’ and ‘now’:\n\n\n\nm is past\nm is earlier than now\n\n\n\nm is earlier than the time of utterance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 The B-Theory of Time\nThe B-Theory of time makes do without the A-series or the distinction between past, present, and future. Here is J.J. C. Smart in (Smart 1963), p. 132:\n\nOne can easily get the idea that the notions of past, present, and future apply objectively to the universe. In contrast, I shall argue that the concepts of past, present, and future have significance only relative to human thought and utterance and do not apply to the universe as such. They contain a hidden anthropocentricity. So also do tenses. On the other hand, the concepts of ‘earlier’, ‘simultaneous’, and ‘later’ are impeccably non-anthropocentric. I shall argue for a view of the world as a four-dimensional continuum of space-time entities, such that out of relation to particular human beings or other language users there is no distinction of ‘past’, ‘present’, and ‘future’. Moreover, the notion of the flow of time is the result of similar confusions. Our notion of time as flowing, the transitory aspect of time…, is an illusion which precents us seeing the world as it really is.\n\nThe B-theorist pictures time as a fourth dimension perfectly akin to the usual three spatial dimensions: length, width, and height. For the sake of simplicity, we will draw spacetime diagrams that represent time as another dimension T alongside two spatial dimensions X and Y. The diagram below represents the spatiotemporal trace left by each a two-dimensional and a one-dimensional object:",

    "text": "To persist is to be wholly present at more than one time within a certain interval.\nTo persist is to be partly present at each moment of an interval and to be wholly present at only at the whole interval\n\n\n\nLet us say that something persists iff, somehow or other, it exists at various times; this is the neutral word. Something perdures iff it persists by having different temporal parts, or stages, at different times, though no one part of it is wholly present at more than one time; whereas it endures iff it persists by being wholly present at more than one time.\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Perdurance\nTo perdure is to be partly present at multiple times.\nEvents appear to perdure. They have temporal extent and parts of the event occupy briefer time periods, e.g., this course is part of a summer school and it consists of three temporally extended lectures over the course of a week.\nTo use Ted Sider’s illustration in (Sider 2003), consider your own life:\n\nThink of your life as a long story. … Like all stories, this story has parts. We can distinguish the part of the story concerning childhood from the part concerning adulthood. Given enough details, there will be parts concerning individual days, minutes, or even instants.\nAccording to the ‘four-dimensional’ conception of persons (and all other objects that persist over time), persons are a lot like their stories. Just as my story has a part for my childhood, so I have a part consisting just of my childhood. Just as my story has a part describing just this instant, so I have a part that is me-at-this-very-instant.\n\nYou, for the four-dimensionalist, are nothing but an aggregrate of person stages. Here is an illustration of perdurance from (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024):\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Endurance\nTo endure is to be wholly present at multiple times.\n\nI have been wholly present in the twentieth century.\nI have been wholly present in the twenty first century.\nI have been wholly present in two centuries, which are disjoint temporal intervals.\n\nBut what exactly is for me to be wholly present somewhere?\nConsider the case of spatial location. To say that I’m wholly present in the room is presumably to say that all of my parts are in the room. That would not be the case, for example, if I step over the threshold or stick my head out of the door. It may seem that to be wholly present in the room is much like to be entirely within the room, but there are exotic counterexamples to the identification. Consider the case depicted by Figure 5a in (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024):\n\n\n\n\n\nThe object \\(o_1\\) in the diagram is an extended simple, which is wholly present in both \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\). It is, however, not entirely within either \\(r_1\\) or \\(r_2\\). So, if there are extended simples, then since no part of them fails to be found at a region at which they are found. So, they are wholly present at every region at which they can be found.\nLet us now return to temporal location. One may now gloss wholly present at a time or time interval similarly. To be wholly present now is for all parts to be found now.\nWhen we deploy the gloss to the case with which we started, we find:\n\nAll of my parts have been found in the twentieth century.\nAll of my parts have been found in the twenty first century.\nAll of my parts have been found in two centuries, which are disjoint temporal intervals.\n\nTed Sider has objected to this gloss in (Sider 2003). Since I have often gained new parts over the years, it is not true that all of my parts could be found back in the twentieth century. So, it is false that I have been wholly present in the twentieth century, since some of the newer parts have not be found there.\nHe briefly considers a reply on behalf of the endurantist. Maybe the relation of part to whole should itself taken to be relative to a time in which case would rephrase the statements as follows:\n\nAll of my parts in the twentieth century have been found in the twentieth century.\nAll of my parts in the twenty first century have been found in the twenty first century.\nAll of my parts in each century have been found in each century, evn though the two centuries are disjoint temporal intervals.\n\nTrue, but unremarkable. Even the perdurantist will agree to that gloss.\n(Parsons 2007) would question the first horn of the dilemma. To endure, for him, is to be a temporally extended simple: to the extent to which I’m a temporally extended object without temporal parts, I’m wholly present now despite the fact that I’m not entirely present now much like the extended simple \\(o_1\\) may be wholly present at \\(r_1\\) without being entirely within \\(r_1\\).\nHere is an illustration of the present model of endurance drawn from (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024):\n\nThere is an alternative model of endurance in the literature, one on which persistence is regarded as akin to travel through time. To travel through time is to occupy different moments in time in its temporal entirety. This is parallel to a view of travel through space in terms of the occupation of different places in space in its spatial entirety. Unfortunately, the analogy breaks down, since travel through space presupposes time as a dimension of variation. There is no similar dimension of variation one may appeal to in order to make sense of travel through time.\nWe will revisit the difficulty later once we develop a framework to regiment talk of temporal location. In the meantime, the picture that emerges is one of a three-dimensional object in a certain locative relation to different time instants. The illustration below appears in (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024).\n\nWe will postpone the question of how to articulate the locational model of endurance until next time. In the meantime, however, we look at the interaction between the models of persistence and the problem of change.",

    "section": "2.2 The Problem of Change",
    "text": "2.2 The Problem of Change\nConsider the case of a candle as described by Sally Haslanger in (Haslanger 2003):\n\nSuppose I put a new 7-inch taper on the table before dinner and light it. At the end of dinner when I blow it out, it is only 5 inches long. We know that a single object cannot have incompatible properties, and being 7 inches long and being 5 inches long are incompatible. So instead of there being one candle that was on the table before dinner and also after, there must be two distinct candles: the 7-inch taper and the 5-inch taper. But of course the candle didn’t shrink instantaneously from 7 inches long to 5 inches long: during the soup course it was 6.5 inches long; during the main course it was 6 inches long; during dessert it was 5.5 inches long. Following the thought that no object can have incompatible lengths, we must conclude, it seems, that during dinner there were several (actually many more than just several) candles on the table in succession.\n\n\nThere is one candle on the table throughout the duration of the dinner.\nOne and the same candle has changed in length from one time before the dinner to another after dinner.\nBut the lengths are incompatible with one another, since nothing is both 7-inches long and 5-inches long.\nChange in length appears to entail the successive possession of incompatible lengths.\n\nHaslanger uncovers four presuppositions involved in the puzzle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistence\nOne and the same object persists through change.\n\n\nIncompatibility\nChange involves incompatible qualities.\n\n\nNon-Contradiction\nNothing exemplifies incompatible qualities.\n\n\nProper Subject\nThe proper subject of the attribution of incompatible qualities is the object to which the change applies.\n\n\n\nDifferent models of persistence suggest different responses to the problem of change.\n\n2.2.1 Perdurantist Change\nPerdurantists deny the Proper Subject condition. The candle is a four-dimensional object, and it is not 5-inches or 7-inches long. It is only instantaneous temporal parts of the candle that exemplify the incompatible qualities.\nFrom the perspective of a perdurantist, change is akin to spatial variation:\n\nThe candle varies in color from place to place because different spatial parts of the candle exemplify different colors.\nThe candle varies in length from time to time because different temporal parts of the candle exemplify different lengths.\n\nHere is (Sider 2003), p. 2:\n\nA person’s journey through time is like a road’s journey through space. The dimension along which a road travels is like time; a perpendicular axis across the road is like space. Parts cut the long way – lanes – are like spatial parts, whereas parts cut crosswise are like temporal parts. US Route 1 extends from Maine to Florida by having subsections in the various regions along its path. The bit located in Philadelphia is a mere part of the road, just as it is only a mere part of me that is contained in 1998.\nA road changes from one place to another by having dissimilar sub-sections. Route 1 changes from bumpy to smooth by having distinct bumpy and smooth subsections. On the four-dimensional picture, change over time is analogous: I change from sitting to standing by having a temporal part that sits and a later temporal part that stands.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Endurantist Change\nThis is not open to endurantists for whom the candle is a temporally extended simple. They deny, for example, that the candle has momentary temporal parts with different lengths.\nEndurantists tend to deny the Incompatibility condition. There is, however, more than one way in which the relevant qualities may be made to be compatible:\n\nThe A-theoretic approach takes tense seriously. The relevant attributions are tensed. Compare with McTaggart’s original puzzle. The A-theorist takes sense seriously in order to accommodate change from future to present to past. That is, we should distinguish between the fact that a moment of time will be present and the fact that it is now present, and the fact that it has been present. Likewise, for the A-theorist, we should distinguish between the fact that the candle will be 5-inches long, the fact that the candle is now 6-inches long, and finally, the fact that the candle has been 7-inches long. There is no incompatibility between those lengths provided their attribution is properly understood.\nThe B-theoretic approach construes the qualities as relations to times. That is, you may be an endurantist even if you subscribe to the B-theoretic picture of time as a static fourth dimension of variation. You may now draw a distinction between the fact that the candle is 5-inches long at one time, and it is 7-inches long at another time.\n\nDavid Lewis claims that the B-theoretic approach rests on a mistake in (Lewis 1986):\n\n[Maybe] shapes are not genuine intrinsic properties. They are disguised relations, which an enduring thing may bear to times. One and the same enduring thing may bear the bent-shape relation to some times, and the straight-shape relation to others. In itself, considered apart from its relations to other things, it has no shape at all. And likewise for all other seeming temporary intrinsics… The solution to the problem of temporary intrinsics is that there aren’t any temporary intrinsics. This is simply incredible, if we are speaking of the persistence of ordinary things.… If we know what shape is, we know that it is a property, not a relation.\n\n\nA quality is temporary if and only if it is had at some times but not others, e.g., being a student, being married, being bent, etc.\nA quality is intrinsic if and only if it is had by a material object merely in virtue of the way the object is and not in virtue of the fact that it stands in certain relations to other objects, e.g., being round, being bent, etc. Intrinsic qualities are shared by duplicates.\n\nThere is route from temporary intrinsics to perdurance:\n\nMaterial objects change from being bent to being straight.\nChange from a bent to a straight shape reveals that they are either not temporary intrinsics or not incompatible after all.\nIf a bent and a straight shape are temporary intrinsics, then they are incompatible.\nEither a bent shape is not intrinsic or a bent shape is not temporary.\nIf a bent shape is not intrinsic, then it is a quality an object instantiates in virtue of of a relation to a time.\nA bent shape is not a quality an object instantiates in virtue of a relation to a time.\nSo, a bent shape is not a temporary quality.\nIf a bent shape is not a temporary quality, then it must be instantiated by a temporal part of material objects.\nSo, there are temporal parts.\n\n\n\n\n\nGilmore, Cody, Claudio Calosi, and Damiano Costa. 2024. “Location and Mereology.” In The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, edited by Edward N.

    "text": "3.1 Mereology\nThe debate over persistence has suffered from a certain amount of imprecision. We initially explained that to persist is to be found, to be present, and even to exist at more than one time. And we explained that to be present at a time is not the same as being entirely present at the time. Philosophers often use locational vocabulary such as ‘occupies a region’ or ‘exactly occupies a region’ in subtly different ways, which may exacerbate the problem.\nTalk of temporal location may in fact interact with mereological talk of part and whole, e.g., as in the characterization of what is for something to be wholly present somewhere.\nIn response to the problem of imprecission, (Parsons 2007) outlined a formal framework for location, one in which one could characterize a family of locational relations in terms of each other and further mereological vocabulary.\nMereology is the formal theory of the part to whole relation.\nThere is a primitive binary relation of part to whole, which we symbolize \\(\\leq\\). We may now define other predicates in terms of part:\nMost axiomatizations of mereology agree on a common core of three axioms to the effect that the relation of part to whole is a partial order of the domain. Reflexivity makes sure that every object is part of itself; anti-symmetry bars different objects from being mutual parts; and transitivity states that if an object is part of another, and the second part of a third, then the first is part of the third.",

On the other hand, core mereology seems beyond doubt when it comes to spatial, temporal, and, more generally, spatiotemporal regions.\nOne more axiom concerns the question of how a whole may decompose into further proper parts. If one object is not part of another, then the latter has some part with no parts in common with the former. If a statue, for example, is not part of its torso, then it includes some part, e.g., its head, with no parts in common with its torso. One important consequence of the axiom is the extensionality of overlap and proper part, respectively: two objects are identical if they overlap exactly the same objects, and two objects are identical if they share all of their proper parts.\n\n\n3.1.2 Extensional Mereology\nExtensional mereology is the axiomatization that results when we enrich Core Mereology with an axiom of Strong Supplementation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx \\nleq y \\to \\exists z (z \\leq x \\wedge \\neg z \\circ y) & & \\text{Strong Supplementation}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe axiom has been called into question when it comes to material objects. Some philosophers deny that the statue is part of the clay of which it is made, yet they deny that the clay has parts that are disjoint of the statue since they are after all made out of the same matter.\nOn the other hand, the axiom seems reasonable for spatial, temporal, and even spatiotemporal regions. Consider the spatial case. If \\(r\\) is a spatial region and \\(s\\) is not a subregion of \\(r\\), then \\(s\\) must include a subregion that does not overlap \\(r\\). If you conceive of regions as sets of points, then a region is part of another iff the latter contains each and every point in the former. But if \\(s\\) is not part of \\(r\\), then \\(s\\) must include points that are not in \\(r\\), and a set of such points should itself count as a part of \\(s\\), which fails to overlap \\(r\\).\nEven more problematic is the axiom of Fusion according to which every set has a mereological fusion by which we mean a fusion which includes as parts all members of the set and only objects which overlap some member of the set.\n\n\n3.1.3 Classical Extensional Mereology\nClassical Extensional Mereology is the axiomatization that results from Extensional Mereology when we add the axiom of fusion:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nS \\neq \\emptyset \\to \\exists x (\\forall y (y \\in S \\to y \\leq x) \\wedge \\forall y(y \\leq x \\to \\exists z (y \\circ z \\wedge z \\in S)) & & \\text{Fusion}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFusion has been controversial, for one may doubt that every set, no matter how heterogeneous, gives rise to a whole whose parts are exactly those that overlap the members of the set. But when combined with the axioms of Extensional Mereology, we find that not only do such fusions exist, but they are unique too.\nWhile (Lewis 1986) takes the axioms of Classical Extensional Mereology to be akin to logic, others have rejected them for material objects. Fewer have questioned the truth of the axioms for spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal regions, but for present purposes, we will make do with the assumption that locations, whether spatial or temporal, are governed by the axioms of Extensional Mereology.",

    "text": "3.2 Theories of Location\nWe now proceed to distinguish four basic relations, which will enable us to clarify what is meant by the claim that an occupant is found or present at a location and how to distinguish it from the claim that is is entirely or exactly found or present at that location.\n\n3.2.1 Four Locative Relations\n(Parsons 2007) makes a distinction between four relations, which we illustrate by means of the diagram found in (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024):\n\n\n\nHere \\(d\\) is a material object; \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_5\\) are two pentagonal regions; \\(r_2\\) is a triangular region; \\(r_4\\) is a circular region; and, finally, \\(r_4\\) is a rectangular region.\n\n\n\nWeak location\nI’m weakly located in the room simply because the room is not free of me. I will remain weakly located in the room if step through the threshold even if some of me remains in the room.\nWe will write:\n\n\\(o\\) is weakly located at \\(r\\), in symbols: \\(o @_\\circ r\\).\n\nIn the diagram above:\n\n\\(d\\) is weakly located at \\(r_2\\), \\(r_3\\), \\(r_4\\), and \\(r_5\\).\n\\(d\\) is not weakly located at \\(r_1\\).\n\nWe have used a spatial example, but weak location is what we have in mind when we say that something is found or present at a time or a temporal interval.\nEntire location\nI’m entirely located in the room because I’m in the room and I am nowhere outside the room. I will no longer be entirely located in the room if I step through the threshold even if some of me remains in the room.\nWe will write:\n\n\\(o\\) is entirely located at \\(r\\), in symbols: \\(o @_&lt; r\\)\n\nIn the diagram:\n\n\\(d\\) is entirely located at \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_4\\).\n\\(d\\) is not entirely located at \\(r_1\\) or \\(r_2\\).\n\nIn the case of time, entire location is what we mean when we say that something is entirely found or entirely present at a time or temporal interval.\nPervasive Location\nI pervade a region if none of it is free of me. I do not pervade the room, but I pervade the region exactly occupied by my hand.\nWe will write:\n\n\\(o\\) pervades at \\(r\\), in symbols: \\(o @_&gt; r\\)\n\nIn the diagram:\n\n\\(d\\) pervades both \\(r_4\\) and \\(r_5\\).\n\\(d\\) does not pervade \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), or \\(r_3\\).\n\nPerfect Location\nI’m perfectly located at a region if I am entirely located in the region and I pervade the region. My perfect location in space is like the shadow I cast in space.\nWe will write:\n\n\\(o\\) is exactly located at \\(r\\), in symbols: \\(o @_= r\\).\n\nIn the diagram:\n\n\\(d\\) is exactly located at \\(r_3\\).\n\\(d\\) is exactly located at \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), \\(r_4\\), or \\(r_5\\).\n\n\nThis is one place where we depart from (Parsons 2007), who uses the term ‘exact location’ to refer to what we have called perfect location.\n\n\n3.2.2 Two Theories of Location\nThere is no reason to take all four relations as basic. We may instead take one relation as basic and define the other three in terms of it in combination with other fundamental principles.\nWeak Location\nOne approach is to take weak location as basic and defines the other three in terms of it:\n\n\\(o\\) is entirely located at \\(r\\) if, and only if, \\(o\\) is weakly located at \\(r\\) and \\(o\\) is only weakly located at regions \\(r\\) overlaps. \\[\no @_&lt; r := o @_\\circ r \\wedge \\forall s (o @_\\circ s \\to r \\circ s)\n\\]\n\\(o\\) pervades \\(r\\) if, and only if, \\(o\\) is weakly located at each and every region \\(r\\) overlaps. \\[\no @_&gt; r := \\forall s (r \\circ s \\to o @_\\circ s)\n\\]\n\\(o\\) is perfectly located at \\(r\\) if, and only if, \\(o\\) both pervades and is entirely located at \\(r\\). \\[\no @_= r := o @_&gt; r \\wedge o @_&lt; s\n\\] Or, equivalently: \\[\no @_= r := \\forall s (o @_\\circ s \\leftrightarrow r \\circ s)\n\\]\n\nThere is a further axiom one must add by hand, namely, a principle to the effect that whatever is weakly located somewhere is in fact perfectly located somewhere (or somewhere else). This is what (Parsons 2007) calls Exactness:\n\\[\n\\exists r \\ x @_\\circ r \\to  \\exists r \\ x @_= r \\tag{Exactness}\n\\]\nOne immediate consequence of the definitions above is that perfect location is unique if it exists. This in turn is a principle (Parsons 2007) dubs Functionality:\n\\[\nx @_= r_1 \\wedge x @_= r_2 \\to r_1 = r_2 \\tag{Functionality}\n\\]\nPerfect Location\nThe other approach is to take perfect location as basic and define the other three relations in terms of it in combination with Functionality as a further axiom:\n\n\\(o\\) is weakly located at \\(r\\) if, and only if, \\(o\\) is perfectly located at some region \\(r\\) overlaps: \\[\no @_\\circ r := \\exists s (o @_= s \\wedge r \\circ s)\n\\]\n\\(o\\) is entirely located at \\(r\\) if, and only if, \\(o\\) is perfectly located at a location of which \\(r\\) is part. \\[\no @_&lt; r := \\exists s (o @_= s \\wedge s \\leq r)\n\\]\n\\(o\\) pervades \\(r\\) if, and only if, \\(o\\) is exactly located at some part of \\(r\\). \\[\no @_&gt; r := \\exists s (o @_= s \\wedge r \\leq s)\n\\]\n\nExactness is a direct consequence of the definition of weak location in terms of perfect location, which means that there is no need to add it by hand as an axiom.\n\n\n3.2.3 Endurance Revisited\nWe will now distinguish two models of endurance and ask whether we have the resources to make sense of them.\nMereological Endurance\nOn one model of endurance, to persist is to be wholly located at every time at which one exists. One may now wonder how whole location is supposed to compare with the four relations we considered above.\n\n\\(o\\) is wholly located at \\(r\\) if, and only if, every part of \\(o\\) is weakly located at \\(r\\).\n\\[\no @_\\blacktriangleleft r := \\forall y (y \\leq x \\to y @_\\circ r)\n\\]\n\nWhile this relation may seem similar to entire location, they are not to be confused for reasons we have discussed before. For recall the diagram below drawn from (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024):\n\n\n\n\n\nSince \\(o_1\\) is a simple object, it has only itself as a part. Because \\(o_1\\) is weakly located at \\(r_1\\) and no part of \\(o_1\\) fails to be weakly located at \\(r_1\\), we conclude that \\(o\\) is wholly located at \\(r_1\\). On the other hand, \\(o_1\\) is not entirely located at \\(r_1\\) simply because \\(o_1\\) is weakly located somewhere outside \\(r_1\\), namely, \\(r_3\\). So, whole and entire location will come apart in the spatial case if there are spatially extended simples.\nHere is how one may use the definitions above to regiment endurance:\n\n\\(x\\) endures if and only if \\(\\exists t \\exists r (\\neg t \\circ r \\wedge x @_\\blacktriangleleft t \\wedge x @_\\blacktriangleleft r)\\)\n\nThis definition allows for mixed cases in which a continuant endures by being wholly located only at some of the times at which it exists. To rule that out, we may say that an object endures throughout if it is wholly located at every time at which it exists.\n\n\\(x\\) endures throughout if and only if \\(x\\) persists and \\(\\forall t(x@_\\circ t \\to x @_\\blacktriangleleft t)\\).\n\nThe model of endurance that emerges is that of a temporally extended simple as illustrated by the picture drawn from (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024):\n\nNotice, incidentally, that (Parsons 2007) has the means to offer an account of temporal parts in terms of the vocabulary of the framework:\n\n\\(x\\) is a temporal part of \\(y\\) at \\(T\\) if, and only if, \\(x\\) is a fusion of the set of objects \\(z\\) such that \\(z \\leq y\\) and \\(z @_\\blacktriangleleft T\\).\n\nOn this definition, if \\(y\\) exists at \\(T\\) but endures throughout, then \\(y\\) is the temporal part of \\(y\\) at \\(T\\). Alternatively, we could define:\n\n\\(x\\) is a proper temporal part of \\(y\\) at \\(T\\) if, and only if, \\(x\\) is a fusion of the set of objects \\(z\\) such that \\(z \\leq y\\) and \\(z @_&lt; T\\).\n\nOn this definition, if \\(y\\) exists at \\(T\\) but endures throughout, then unless \\(T\\) is the temporal path of \\(y\\), nothing is a proper temporal part of \\(y\\) at \\(T\\).\nLocational Endurance\nWe still seem to lack the resources to make sense of an alternative model of endurance, one on which the occupant is multilocated by which proponents mean exactly located at many different moments. Here is how Cody Gilmore glosses the model in (Gilmore 2014):\n\nAt least some material objects persist through time; and every material object is temporally unextended and wholly present at each instant at which it exists at all. Moreover, it is not the case that every material object has a different instantaneous temporal part at each different instant at which it exists.\n\nAnd this is how Parsons describes what he takes to be a misguided reaction to his own characterization of endurance in (Parsons 2007) , p. 218:\n\nAccording to these people, an enduring object is not one that is wholly located at each of many disjoint times, but one that is exactly located at each of many disjoint times.\n\nTo make the model vivid, consider again the diagram from (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024):\n\nThe question now is how to make sense of the putative relation of exact location the occupant is supposed to bear to different times in the temporal path of the object. The occupant is perfectly located at the temporal path depicted by the diagram because it is, on the one hand, entirely, and, on the other, pervasively located in that temporal region.\nHow to Make Sense of Multilocation\nOne approach to the problem is to observe that there is no room for the distinction between the two models of endurance in the framework we have outlined. To return to the spatial case again, we want to draw a distinction between the case of an extended simple and a multilocated simple as illustrated by the diagram below drawn from (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended Simple\nMultilocated Simple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile \\(o_1\\) is an extended simple, \\(o_2\\) is a multilocated simple: \\(o_2\\) is exactly located at \\(r_3\\) and \\(r_4\\). This is the spatial counterpart of the contrast between the mereological and the locational model of endurance. The problem is that we lack the machinery to make sense of that distinction, since the patterns of exemplification of the part whole relation and that of weak location appears to be the same in both cases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended Simple\nMultilocated Simple\n\n\n\n\n\\(o_1 @_\\circ r_1\\), \\(o_1 @_\\circ r_2\\)\n\\(o_2 @_\\circ r_3\\), \\(o_2 @_\\circ r_4\\)\n\n\n\\(x \\leq o_1 \\to x @_\\circ r_1\\)\n\\(x \\leq o_1 \\to x @_\\circ r_2\\)\nEtc\n\\(x \\leq o_2 \\to x @_\\circ r_3\\)\n\\(x \\leq o_2 \\to x @_\\circ r_4\\)\nEtc\n\n\n\nFree of\nWeak location is elucidated in terms of the free of relation: for me to be weakly located in the room is for the room not to be free of me. (Parsons 2007) conceives of the free of relation as a binary relation between a location and an occupant, but we may be able to do better if we take the free of relation as a perfectly general topic-neutral relation: \\(\\alpha\\) is free of \\(\\beta\\), which we will symbolize \\(\\alpha \\ \\sharp \\ \\beta\\). We use Greek variables as placeholders for variables over occupants and locations. For example:\n\nThe room is not free of me. Nor am I free of the room.\nNeither the statue nor the clay is free of each other.\nMy singleton is not free of me. Nor am I free of my singleton.\nTwo adjacent regions are not free of each other.\n\nTo be free of something is not just to …\n\nbe numerically distinct from it\nThe room and I are numerically distinct, yet we are not free of each other.\nto have no parts in common with it\nMy singleton and I have no parts in common, yet we are not free of each other.\n\nWe take the free of relation as basic and governed by three main axioms:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\neg \\alpha \\ \\# \\ \\alpha & & \\text{Irreflexivity}\\\\\n\\alpha \\ \\# \\ \\beta \\to \\beta \\ \\# \\ \\alpha & & \\text{Symmetry}\\\\\n\\alpha \\leq \\beta \\to \\forall \\gamma(\\neg \\gamma \\ \\# \\ \\alpha \\to \\neg \\gamma \\ \\# \\ \\beta) & & \\text{Monotonicity}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nMore tentatively:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\neg \\gamma \\ \\# \\ \\alpha + \\beta \\to \\neg \\gamma \\ \\# \\ \\alpha \\vee \\neg \\gamma \\ \\# \\ \\beta & & \\text{Delegation}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nOne important consequence:\n\nIf \\(\\alpha \\ \\# \\ \\beta\\), then \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) have no parts in common.\n\nWe do not generally have the converse:\n\nThe room and I lack parts in common, yet we are not free of each other.\nMy singleton and I lack parts in common, yet we are not free of each other.\n\nWe do not even have the converse when we restrict attention to locations. In a region-based account of spatial regions:\n\nTwo adjacent regions lack parts in common, yet they are not free of each other.\n\nWeak Location\nWeak location obtains between an occupant \\(x\\) and a location \\(R\\).\nFor \\(x\\) to be weakly located at \\(R\\), \\(x @_\\circ R\\), is for \\(x\\) to not be free of \\(R\\). That is, \\(x @_\\circ R\\) if, and only if, \\(\\neg R \\ \\# \\ x\\).\nMonotonicity and Delegation deliver:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx \\leq y \\to \\forall R (x @_{\\circ} R \\to y @_{\\circ} R) & & \\text{Inheritance}\\\\\nR \\leq S \\to \\forall x (x @_{\\circ} R \\to y @_{\\circ} S) & & \\text{Locational Inheritance}\\\\\nx @_\\circ R_1 + R_2 \\to x @_\\circ R_1 \\vee x @_\\circ R_2 & & \\text{Delegation}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWeak Entire Location\nWe now define a relation of weak entire location:\n\\[\nx@^{-}_&lt; R := x @_\\circ R \\wedge \\forall S (x @_\\circ S \\to \\neg R \\  \\sharp \\ S)\n\\]\nThat opens the way for a distinction between the cases we discussed above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended Simple\nMultilocated Simple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5a diagram: link to extended description below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne could perhaps suggest that \\(o_1\\) is weakly entirely located in both \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) partly because no region that overlaps \\(r_2\\) is free of \\(r_1\\) and vice versa. On the other hand, \\(o_2\\) is not weakly entirely located in either \\(r_3\\) or \\(r_4\\) partly because the regions in question are free of each other.\nContainment\nIn cases of multilocation, we may take the occupant to partly explain the link between the relevant locations. We write that \\(x\\) is contained in \\(R\\) if, and only if, \\(x\\) is weakly located at \\(S\\) and only regions that are not free of \\(R\\) via \\(x\\).\n\\[\nx@_\\prec R := x @_\\circ R \\wedge \\forall S (x @_\\circ S \\to \\neg R \\  \\sharp_{x} \\ S)\n\\]\nPart of the reason \\(o_1\\) is contained in \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) is that is that they are not free of each other via \\(o_1\\), whereas \\(R_3\\) and \\(R_4\\) are free of each other via \\(o_2\\).\nPerfect Containment\nWe are now in a position to define a relation of perfect containment, which \\(o_1\\) bears to both \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) but \\(o_2\\) only bears to \\(R_3 + R_4\\). We will write that \\(x\\) is perfectly contained in \\(R\\) if, and only if \\(x\\) pervades \\(R\\) and \\(R\\) contains \\(x\\).\n\\[\nx@_\\approx R := x @_\\prec R \\wedge x @_&gt; R\n\\]\nWe now have the means to characterize locational endurance:\n\n\\(x\\) endures if and only if \\(\\exists t \\exists r (\\neg t \\circ r \\wedge x @_\\approx t \\wedge x @_\\approx r)\\)\n\nThis definition allows for mixed cases in which a continuant endures by being perfectly contained only at some of the times at which it exists. To rule that out, we may say that an object endures throughout if it is perfectly contained in every time at which it exists.\n\n\\(x\\) endures throughout if and only if \\(x\\) persists and \\(\\forall t(x@_\\circ t \\to x @_\\approx t)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nGilmore, Cody. 2014. “Building Enduring Objects Out of Spacetime.” In Mereology and the Sciences: Parts and Wholes in the Contemporary Scientific Context, edited by Claudio Calosi and Pierluigi Graziani, 5–34.
