    "text": "1.1 What is Time Travel?\nWe will survey four interconnected topics in contemporary metaphysics: time, identity over time, personal identity, and free will. The debate over time travel provides a perhaps unexpected entry point into these topics, and we will pay special attention to (Lewis 1976), which constitutes a canonical presentation of the paradoxes of time travel.\nTime travel is a staple of popular culture, since it appears again and again in science fiction literature, major films and TV series, as well as comics and novels. They often involve incoherent scenarios, e.g., Back to the Future, but there are excellent examples of perfectly consistent time travel scenarios. There is, for example, Robert Heinlein’s “All You Zombies” and “By His Bootstraps” and and Ted Chiang’s “The Merchant and the Alchemist’s Gate”. In film, 12 Monkeys (Terry Gilliam, 1995), and Timecrimes (Nacho Vigalondo, 2007) develop coherent time travel plots. (Wasserman 2017) mentions a few other examples.\nTime travel involves a discrepancy between time and time. When a time traveler enters a time machine, she turns some dials and one minute later she emerges one year into the past. The problem is that the time traveler’s departure and arrival are, on the one hand, separated by one minute, and, on the other, separated by one year, which are unequal amounts of time. As (Lewis 1976) explains the problem and his proposed solution:\nPersonal time involves the assignment of coordinates to events in the time traveler’s trajectory in terms of common regularities with respect to external time, but as (Wasserman 2017) points out, it is a delicate matter to find perfectly general regularities that\nFor Lewis, there is no time travel unless there is a discrepancy between external and personal time. The paradoxes of time travel are supposed to threaten the possibility of time travel, let alone its physical or technological possibility. Once the metaphysical possibility of time travel is secure, we may proceed to ask whether time travel is physically or technologically possible, but that is a question for another day.",

    "text": "How can it be that the same two events, [the time traveler’s] departure and arrival, are separated by two unequal amounts of time? … I reply by distinguishing time itself, external time, as I shall also call it, from the personal time of a particular time traveler: roughly, that what is measured by his wristwatch. His journey takes an hour of his personal time, let us say; his wristwatch reads one hour later at arrival than at departure. But the arrival is more than an hour in external time, if he travels toward the future; or the arrival is before the departure in external time (or less than an hour after). if he travels toward the past.\n\n\n\ncould provide an order and a metric for any object, whether it be a person, a particle, or a time machine.\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Time\n(Lewis 1976) describes time travel as travel within a “four-dimensional manifold of events”. On this view, time is akin to the three spatial dimensions in three-dimensional Euclidean space. But the thought that time is a dimension like space remains highly controversial. Some philosophers have argued for at least two important disanalogies between time and space:\n\nThere are objective differences between what events are present, past, and future, whereas there is no objective difference between what location is here and what location is there.\nPresent events and objects are more real than events and objects that have now passed into the past or have not yet come to pass. On the other hand, it would be absurd to declare that events and objects located here are more real than those located in Europe or Australia.\n\nOne alleged difference between time and space concerns the status of tense and the other concerns the ontology of time, and they will be the topic of the first unit of the course. The philosophers in question are sometimes called \\(A\\)-theorists and they are contrasted to \\(B\\)-theorists such as Lewis. The terminology traces back to (McTaggart 1908).\n\n\n1.1.2 Identity Over Time\nNot only does spacetime constitute a four-dimensional manifold, we, and all objects, inhabit this four-dimensional manifold and describe a trajectory within it. Each time we inhabit determines a three-dimensional temporal stage of a four-dimensional object. We are each a four-dimensional object of which each temporal stage is a part. Change, for Lewis, is variation across stages of a single four-dimensional object.\n\nEnduring things are timelike streaks: wholes composed of temporal parts, or stages, located at various times and places. Change is qualitative difference between different stages—different temporal parts—of some enduring thing, just as a “change” in scenery from east to west is a qualitative difference between the eastern and western spatial parts of the landscape. If this paper should change your mind about the possibility of time travel, there will be a difference of opinion between two different temporal parts of you, the stage that started reading and the subsequent stage that finishes.\n\nOne and the same object may be five feet tall at one time in virtue of the height of the relevant temporal part and six feet tall at another time in virtue of the height of a different temporal part. This picture helps Lewis make sense of another time travel puzzle:\n\nA time traveler who talks to himself, on the telephone perhaps, looks for all the world like two different people talking to each other. … What’s true is that he, unlike the rest of us, has two different complete stages located at the same time at different places. What reason have I, then, to regard him as one person and not two?\n\nBut this again is not how some philosophers characterize the persistence of objects over time. Some philosophers object that:\n\nObjects are wholly present at each time at which they exist. They are three-dimensional objects located at different times in the four-dimensional manifold.\nChange is not a matter of variation across temporal stages, since we each have at most one temporal stage at each time at which we exist. Instead, one account may be that one and the same object may be five feet tall at one time and six feet tall at another in virtue of the relations that object bears to each time.\n\nThis is the topic of the second unit on persistence.\n\n\n1.1.3 Personal Identity\nThe problem of personal identity is a special case of the original problem. Never mind the question of what makes the relevant three-dimensional objects stages of the same material object, there is the further question of what makes them stages of the same person given how heterogeneous their mental states may seem to us. As (Lewis 1976) puts the difficulty:\n\nWhat unites his stages, including the simultaneous ones, into a single person? The problem of personal identity is expecially acute if he is the sort of time traveler whose journeys are instantaneous, a broken streak consisting of several unconnected segments. Then the natural way to regard him as more than one person is to take each segment as a different person.\n\nHe answers that they are stages of the same person in virtue of the mental continuity and connectedness they exemplify with respect to a specific choice of coordinates in terms of personal time:\n\nI answer that what unites the stages (or segments) of a time traveler is the same sort of mental, or mostly mental, continuity and connectedness that unites anyone else. The only difference is that whereas a common person is connected and continuous with respect to external time, the time traveler is connected and continuous only with respect to his own personal time.\n\nThis presupposes that personal identity is a matter of mental continuity and connectedness on which there is less than universal agreement. For at least two reasons:\n\nMental continuity and connectedness may come apart from bodily continuity and connectedness, and someone may take the latter, and not the former, as a necessary and sufficient condition for personal identity over time.\nOne person at one time may be mentally continuous and connected with two persons at a later time. But to the extent to which the latter two persons are different from each other, the former cannot be the same person as both of them.\n\nThe second point raises a further question. For you may agree that mental continuity and connectedness is in fact not sufficient for personal identity over time and nonetheless claim that it is what matters in survival. You should be glad that someone is mentally continuous and connected with you in the future even if that person is strictly not the same person as you.\nThis is the topic of the third unit of the course, where we will focus on the debate over what it takes for someone at one time to be the same person as someone else at a later time.\n\n\n1.1.4 What Time Travelers Cannot Do\nWe will close with the question of whether we have free will for which we will use the grandfather paradox as an entry point. Here is how David Lewis introduces the problem in (Lewis 1976):\n\nConsider Tim. He detests his grandfather, whose success in the munitions trade built the family fortune that paid for Tim’s time machine. Tim would like nothing so much as to kill Grandfather, but alas he is too late. Grandfather died in his bed in 1957, while Tim was a young boy. But when Tim has built his time machine and traveled to 1920, suddenly he realizes that he is not too late after all. He buys a rifle; he spends long hours in target practice; he shadows Grandfather to learn the route of his daily walk to the munitions works; he rents a room along the route; and there he lurks, one winter day in 1921, rifle loaded, hate in his heart, as Grandfather walks closer, closer …\n\nCan Tim kill Grandfather? On the one hand, as Lewis notes, there seems to be reason to think so:\n\nHe has what it takes. Conditions are perfect in every way: the best rifle money could buy, Grandfather an easy target only twenty yards away, not a breeze, door securely locked against intruders. Tim a good shot to begin with and now at the peak of training, and so on. What’s to stop him? The forces of logic will not stay his hand! No powerful chaperone stands by to defend the past from interference … In short, Tim is as much able to kill Grandfather as anyone ever is to kill anyone.\n\nBut, on the other hand, Lewis points out that there seem to be reasons to think Tim cannot in fact kill Grandfather:\n\nGrandfather lived, so to kill him would be to change the past. But the events of a past moment … cannot change. Either the events of 1921 timelessly do include Tim’s killing of Grandfather, or else they timelessly don’t … It is logically impossible that Tim should change the past by killing Grandfather in 1921. So, Tim cannot kill Grandfather.\n\nHere is the timeline Lewis describes:\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to motivate the question of free will is to ask the extent to which we are better off than the time traveler. Consider the device Ted Chiang describes in his science-fiction piece (Chiang 2005):\n\nBy now you’ve probably seen a Predictor; millions of them have been sold by the time you’re reading this. For those who haven’t seen one, it’s a small device, like a remote for opening your car door. Its only features are a button and a big green LED. The light flashes if you press the button. Specifically, the light flashes one second before you press the button.\n\nThe Predictor provides a glance into the future, since the flash is in fact supposed to be correlated with the user’s future action. The Predictor flashes only if the user will in fact press the button:\n\nThe heart of each Predictor is a circuit with a negative time delay — it sends a signal back in time. The full implications of the technology will become apparent later, when negative delays of greater than a second are achieved, but that’s not what this warning is about. The immediate problem is that Predictors demonstrate that there’s no such thing as free will.\n\nSuppose you the light flashes in your Predictor. Can you refrain from pressing the button one second after the flash? On the one hand, it would seem to be entirely up to you to press or not press the button one second after you the light flashes. On the other hand, the events of a future moment … cannot change. Either the events after the flash timelessly do include your pressing the button exactly one second after the flash or they do not … But if the flash is correlated with the fact that you will press the button, then it is logically impossible that you should change the future by refraining from pressing the button exactly one second after the flash. So, you cannot refrain from pressing the button.\nHere is a diagrammatic representation of the situation:\n\nThe thought that you cannot change the future may lead one to think that they lack free will, which would, on the face of it, undercut one’s motivation. Here is how (Chiang 2005) illustrates the concern:\n\nTypically, a person plays with a Predictor compulsively for several days, showing it to friends, trying various schemes to outwit the device. The person may appear to lose interest in it, but no one can forget what it means — over the following weeks, the implications of an immutable future sink in. Some people, realizing that their choices don’t matter, refuse to make any choices at all. Like a legion of Bartleby the Scriveners, they no longer engage in spontaneous action. Eventually, a third of those who play with a Predictor must be hospitalized because they won’t feed themselves. The end state is akinetic mutism, a kind of waking coma. They’ll track motion with their eyes, and change position occasionally, but nothing more. The ability to move remains, but the motivation is gone\n\n\n\n\n\nChiang, Ted. 2005. “What’s Expected of Us.” Nature 436 (July): 150.\n\n\nLewis, David. 1976. “The Paradoxes of Time Travel.” American Philosophical Quarterly 13 (2): 145–52.\n\n\nMcTaggart, John Ellis. 1908. “The Unreality of Time.” Mind 17 (68): 457–74. https://doi.org/10.1093/mind/xvii.4.457.\n\n\nWasserman, Ryan. 2017.

    "text": "2.1 Is Time Real?\nIn order to understand two approaches to the metaphysics of time, we must come to terms with an argument for the unreality of time due to John McTaggart in (McTaggart 1908). He contrasts two sorts of distinctions between what he calls positions in time or moments:\nBecause some distinctions are permanent and others are not, he distinguished two descriptions of a series of moments or events by appeal to each type of distinction.\nIf there is time, then there is a series of moments, and we may well ask whether they form an \\(A\\)-series or a \\(B\\)-series.\nJohn McTaggart proceeded to argue for the unreality of time in (McTaggart 1908). The argument proceeds from two main premises:\nIn support of the first premise, M1, McTaggart argued that there is no time without change:\nA world without change would, for McTaggart, be a timeless world. But what could change consist in in a series of moments of time? According to McTaggart change can only consist in the transition from future to near future, to present, to near past, to past. Nothing else could account for the existence of change in a series of moments.\nConsider an event such as the final game of the World Series. It is true that the event features different qualities at different moments of time: the scoreline may be different from one inning to another. But that is not sufficient for real change: it is permanently the case that the scoreline remained 0-0 at the end of the first inning, 1-0 at the end of the second inning, etc. On the one hand, the first inning eventually changed from future to near future to present to near past to past, etc. Change requires a variation in A-properties like past, present, and future.\nBertrand Russell, and others, found the second premise doubtful:\nAs should be plain by now, McTaggart denies that the mere fact that the poker is hot on a Monday but not hot on a different day is sufficient for change. Real change, for McTaggart, requires a moment to change with respect to its A-properties.\nCould we make do with a B-series of moments? For McTaggart, the B-series depends on the existence of an A-series. For B-relations, as McTaggart understands them, depend on the existence of A-properties: for a moment to be earlier than another is for one to eventually be present when the other is future or to be past while the other is present.\nWe could, as McTaggart explains, conceive of a series of moments related to each other by perfectly permanent relations, which McTaggart calls the C-series, but they have no temporal order according to McTaggart.\nIn support of the second premise, M2, McTaggart reasoned:\nIn support of the first premise, McTaggart argues that for a moment to change from future to present to past, it must exemplify all three qualities: past, present, and future.\nYet:\nBut that means that no moment of time can coherently be all three: past, present, and future.",

    "section": "2.2 Two Responses to McTaggart’s Argument: The A-Theory and the B-Theory of Time",
    "text": "2.2 Two Responses to McTaggart’s Argument: The A-Theory and the B-Theory of Time\nThe master argument is valid, which means that we must either reject at least one premise or else embrace the unreality of time. Two approaches to the metaphysics of time arise in line with the rejection of each premise of the argument. A-theorists tend to reject M2, whereas B-theorists reject M1.\n\n2.2.1 The A-Theory of Time\nThe A-theoretic picture of time maintains that there is an A-series of moments of time, which are subject to change from future to present to past. That means that they reject M2. To that purpose, they must respond to the argument McTaggart offers in support of that premise.\nMcTaggart is aware that the premise that moments are future, present, and past may seem doubtful when we switch to a tensed formulation of the relevant predications.\nIf \\(m\\) is now present, then:\n\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis future\nhas been future\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis present\nis now present\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis past\nwill be past\n\n\n\nIf \\(m\\) is now future, then:\n\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis future\nis now future\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis present\nwill be present\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis past\nwill be past\n\n\n\nIf \\(m\\) is now past, then:\n\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis future\nhas been future\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis present\nhas been present\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis past\nis now past\n\n\n\nMcTaggart replies that this is a distinction without a difference:\n\nBut this explanation involves a vicious circle. For it assumes the existence of time in order to account for the way in which moments are past, present and future. Time then must be pre-supposed to account for the A series. But we have already seen that the A series has to be assumed in order to account for time. Accordingly the A series has to be presupposed in order to account for the A series. And this is clearly a vicious circle.\n\nFor McTaggart:\n\n‘has been such-and-such’ just is ‘is such-and-such at some past moment’.\n‘is now such-and-such’ just is ‘is such-and-such at a present moment’.\n‘will be such-and-such’ is just ‘is such-and-such at some future moment’.\n\n, since there is a simple paraphrase for each tensed predication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nhas been future\nis future at a past moment \\(p\\)\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis now present\nis present at a present moment \\(q\\)\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nwill be past\nis past at a future moment \\(r\\)\n\n\n\nThe issue now is that to the extent to which the relevant moments of time are part of an A-series, they each are future present and past, which is, for McTaggart, incoherent.\nAn Infinite Regress?\nWe may insist that talk of a past moment is talk of a moment that has been present, talk of a present moment is talk of a moment that is now present, and talk of a future moment is talk of a moment that will be present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis future at a past moment\nis future at a moment that has been present\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis present at a present moment\nis present at a moment that is now present\n\n\n\\(m\\)\nis past at a future moment\nis past at a moment that will be present\n\n\n\nMcTaggart’s response is to insist that talk of a moment that has been present is talk of a moment that is present at some past time in which case we have just postponed the problem. In fact, we could iterate the process ad infinitum, which, for McTaggart, is by itself a reason to reject the existence of an A-series in the first place.\nTaking Tense Seriously\nIn response to McTaggart, C. D. Broad draws a helpful distinction in (Broad 1934) between two styles of predication:\n\n\n\nTenseless Predication\nTensed Predication\n\n\n\n\nThe number two is even\nTwo is now my favorite number\n\n\n\nTwo has been my favorite number\n\n\n\nTwo will be my favorite number\n\n\nThe lecture is new\nThe lecture is now underway\n\n\n\nThe lecture has been underway\n\n\n\nThe lecture will be underway\n\n\n\nOne important difference between the two uses of the expression ‘is’ is that the statements in which it occurs as a tensed copula are often only temporarily true, whereas the statements in which it occurs as a tenseless predicate are sometimes permanently true. To disambiguate, we may use capital letters when we mean the predication to be tenseless.\nNow, McTaggart’s infinite regress arises only when one insists on an analysis of tense in terms of tenseless predication. In McTaggart’s case the proposed analysis takes the form:\n\n\n\nTensed Predication\nTenseless Predication\n\n\n\n\n\\(m\\) has been \\(F\\)\n\\(m\\) IS \\(F\\) at a moment \\(p\\), which IS past.\n\n\n\\(m\\) is now \\(F\\)\n\\(m\\) IS \\(F\\) at a moment \\(q\\), which IS present.\n\n\n\\(m\\) will be \\(F\\)\n\\(m\\) IS \\(F\\) at a moment \\(r\\), which IS future.\n\n\n\nMcTaggart’s Reduction of Tense\nBroad agrees that given the proposed analysis, we are led into an infinite regress. But we should simply reject McTaggart’s invitation to paraphrase the tense in the way he suggests. The proper conclusion from McTaggart’s argument is that tensed predication is irreducible and cannot be analyzed in terms of tenseless predication.\n\\(A\\)-theorists of time tend to take tense seriously much like C. D. Broad recommended in response to McTaggart. They take the B-series to leave something out, namely, which time is now, which times are past, and which times are future. As (Zimmerman 2005) puts the point in p. 431:\n\nThe essence of the A-theory is the objectivity of the distinction between past, present, and future. What is presently true is true, simpliciter, not merely true relative to a time or utterance or situation.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 The B-Theory of Time\nThe B-Theory of time makes do without the A-series or the distinction between past, present, and future. Here is J.J. C. Smart in (Smart 1963), p. 132:\n\nOne can easily get the idea that the notions of past, present, and future apply objectively to the universe. In contrast, I shall argue that the concepts of past, present, and future have significance only relative to human thought and utterance and do not apply to the universe as such. They contain a hidden anthropocentricity. So also do tenses. On the other hand, the concepts of ‘earlier’, ‘simultaneous’, and ‘later’ are impeccably non-anthropocentric. I shall argue for a view of the world as a four-dimensional continuum of space-time entities, such that out of relation to particular human beings or other language users there is no distinction of ‘past’, ‘present’, and ‘future’. Moreover, the notion of the flow of time is the result of similar confusions. Our notion of time as flowing, the transitory aspect of time…, is an illusion which precents us seeing the world as it really is.\n\nThe B-theorist pictures time as a fourth dimension perfectly akin to the usual three spatial dimensions: length, width, and height. For the sake of simplicity, we will draw spacetime diagrams that represent time as another dimension T alongside two spatial dimensions. The diagram below taken from (Wasserman 2017) represents the spatiotemporal trace left by each a two-dimensional object at the present time:\n\nThe B-Theory simply rejects M1 on the grounds that a series of events connected by a series of B-relations is sufficient for the existence of time. Unlike McTaggart, they claim that events stand in B-relations even if there is no genuine difference between future, past, and present.\nFor them, tense is derivative on B-relations. Take the case of tensed predications such as ‘Two is now my favorite number’. They take the word ‘now’ to act as an indexical for the moment of utterance. That is, the word ‘now’ picks out different times for different utterances of the sentence ‘I’m now in LA’ at different times. But that is one reason why the A-theorist will reject the B-theorist attempt to translate ‘m is past’ in terms of ‘earlier than’ and ‘now’:\n\n\n\n\\(m\\) is present\n\\(m\\) is now\n\n\n\n\\(m\\) is simultaneous with the time of utterance\n\n\n\\(m\\) is past\n\\(m\\) is earlier than now\n\n\n\n\\(m\\) is earlier than the time of utterance\n\n\n\\(m\\) is future\n\\(m\\) is later than now\n\n\n\n\\(m\\) is later than the time of utterance",

These facts correspond to the lecture being future, becoming present, and coming to be past. These are objective and irreducible features of the world. Reality is irreducibly tensed and involves change.\nCompeting versions of the A-Theory are united by the commitment to objective differences between past, present, and future, but they may differ with respect to the second question.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Presentism\nPresentists claim that only present events and objects exist. Consider what happens when an event is over and comes to be past. When a lecture is over, for example, it has come to be past and it no longer exists. Nor do future events yet exist. Why we will be on break in March, the break does not exist yet. Only present events exist, e.g., your reading this very sentence. Future events and objects do not exist, though they will come into existence, even if ever so briefly, and past events and objects do not exist, though they used to exist, even if ever so briefly.\n\n\n3.1.2 Moving Spotlight Theory\nPresentism is not forced upon the A-Theory merely by their attitude towards the distinction between past, present, and future. Some A-theorists may note that for the lecture to become present, it must have been something that used to be future but not present. More generally, you may think that for one to anticipate or look forward to an event that has not yet come to be present, the event must have enjoyed some being. Likewise for past events. For one to miss or perhaps regret a past event, the event must still enjoy being. Otherwise, there is nothing for one to miss or two regret. So, one could be an A-Theorist and nonetheless accept the reality of past and future events and objects.\nThe world forms a four-dimensional manifold, which includes past, present, and future events and objects, but only some of those events and objects are present at each given time. The present is very much like a moving spotlight playing over a four-dimensional manifold. The metaphor is due to (Broad 1959), who writes in p. 59:\n\nWe are naturally tempted to regard the history of the world as existing eternally in a certain order of events. Along this, and in a fixed direction, we imagine the characteristic of presentness as moving, somewhat like the spot of light from a policeman’s bull’s-eye traversing the fronts of houses in a street. What is illuminated is the present, what has been illuminated is the past, and what has not yet illuminated is the future.\n\nThe moving spotlight theory agrees with the B-Theory that the universe forms a four-dimensional manifold, but adds that some are past, some present, and some future. Furthermore, present events and objects are special in that they are lit up in some way.\n\n\n3.1.3 Growing Block Theory\n(Broad 1959) did not endorse the Moving Spotlight theory but rather accepted the reality of past and present events and objects, just not future ones. Both past and present events and objects have come into existence, whereas future ones are nothing yet. There is a brief difference between past and present events and objects in that unlike past events, present events precede no other events:\n\nThe essence of a present event is not, that it precedes future events, but that there is quite literally nothing to which it has the relation of precedence.\n\n(Zimmerman 2005) argues that you should be presentist if you are an A-theorist. For both Growing Block and Moving Spotlight theorists face uncomfortable questions. If past or future events and objects are still part of the furniture of the world, then why does it matter whether they are past or future?\n\nWhy exactly should I look forward to a pleasant experience if the experience is part of the world and it is pleasant whether it is lit up or not by the moving spotlight?\nI look forward to a pleasant experience while the experience is future and not yet lit up, but I come to take another attitude toward one and the same event when the event is lit up and yet another once it becomes past.\nWhy exactly should I be glad that a painful event is over if the event is part of the world and painful whether it is lit up or not by the moving spotlight?\nI come to be relieved that the event is over once it becomes past and no longer lit up, but I used to dread the event before it lit up and suffered through it while being hit by the spotlight.\n\nThere is, according to (Zimmerman 2005), no mystery if you are presentist for whom only present events and objects exist:\n\nI look forward to the arrival of the pleasant experience into the world, one with certain qualities I anticipate. Nothing, however, has the very qualities I anticipate in the relevant experience prior to its coming into existence.\nI’m glad the painful event is no longer part of the world. Once the event ceases to be, so do the qualities that used to accompany it.\n\nBoth the Growing Block and Moving Spotlight theorists may attempt to deny that past and future events are pleasant or painful while merely past or merely future, which may provide them with resources to answer the challenge, but they must explain how the mere fact that an event is lit up or present suffices to make it truly pleasant or painful.",

    "text": "3.2 Two Objections to the A-Theory\nWhat follows are two standard objections to the A-Theory.\n\n3.2.1 Objections from Truthmaking\nThe truthmaking objection relies on the assumption that a proposition is true only something in the world makes it true. A true proposition is a fact. The fact that the apple is red is made true by the apple and its instantiation of a certain color. Presentists deny the existence of past and future events and objects, but they countenance past and future facts. They will grant, for example, that dinosaurs used to roam the Earth or that there will soon be human outposts in Mars. The truthmaking objection is the challenge to point to something in the world making true these past and future-oriented propositions:\n\nDinosaurs used to roam the Earth.\nThere will be human outposts in Mars.\n\nBecause there are no dinosaurs or human outposts in Mars according to the presentist, the objection continues, there is nothing in the world now making those propositions true.\n(Zimmerman 2005) responds that the facts in question are tensed, and that the world itself is a truthmaker to them to the extent to which it exemplifies the very tensed properties: having been roamed by dinosaurs and eventually including human outposts in Mars.\n\nThe world used to be roamed by dinosaurs.\nThe world will include human outposts in Mars.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Objections from Relativity Theory\nRelativity is formulated in terms of a four-dimensional manifold of spacetime points. Events and objects, more generally, describe a path within spacetime of which only one spatial cross-section corresponds to the real present moment. That suggests an argument against the presentist formulation of the A-Theory:\n\nThere is a four-dimensional manifold of spacetime points within which a path is described by events and objects.\nIf presentism is true, only present spatial cross-section of such paths exist.\nIf only present spatial-cross sections of such paths exist, then there is no four-dimensional manifold.\nSo, presentism is not true.\n\n(Zimmerman 2005) responds that the four-dimensional manifold is a theoretical posit of which one spatial cross-section is occupied by events and objects. What makes another cross-section a future cross-section of the manifold is that it will be occupied by events and objects in the future, which is perfectly consistent with presentism.\nSince Newtonian spacetime forms a four-dimensional framework, the objection above, if successful, could have been motivated by pre-relativistic physics. Now, for each spacetime point in a Newtonian manifold, there is a hyperplane of simultaneity, which determines whether a spacetime point is simultaneous with the given point. A-theorists may again think of one such hyperplane of simultaneity as the present and claim that what exists forms a spatial cross-section of such a hyperplane. Whether other hyperplanes count as future or past depends on whether they have been or they will be occupied by events and objects.\nMatters are different in Minkowski or relativistic spacetime, which cannot be partitioned into hyperplanes of simultaneity. There is, instead, a relation of relative simultaneity or simultaneity relative to a frame of reference. (Wasserman 2017) illustrates this with the help of diagrams which highlight the difference between what may be simultaneous with a given spacepoint relative to two different observers in different states of motion:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserver 1\nObserver 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpacetime point \\(q\\) comes after \\(p\\) for observer 1, whereas the two are simultaneous for observer 2. There are no further frame-independent facts they may appeal to in order to resolve the disagreement because there are no further facts as to what counts as being absolutely simultaneous with \\(p\\).\nGiven a spacetime point \\(p\\), which may be thought of as the occurrence of a flash of light, there is a well-defined distinction between:\n\nThe absolute future or future light cone of \\(p\\), which is the set of spacetime points accessible from \\(p\\) by the flash of light.\nThe absolute past or past light cone of \\(p\\), which is the set of points from which \\(p\\) would be accessible by a flash of light.\nThe set of points spacelike separated from \\(p\\), which fall outside the light cone structure.\n\nHere is again a diagram drawn from (Wasserman 2017):\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may think of the spacepoints in the future light cone of \\(p\\) as later than \\(p\\), and the spacepoints in the past light cone of \\(p\\) as earlier than \\(p\\), which corresponds to the usual B-theoretic relations. But notice that these distinctions are still relative to a frame of reference, and my vary across frames.\nThis is where the argument against the A-theory begins:\n\nThere is no frame-independent fact of the matter as to which spacetime points are simultaneous with (or earlier than or later than) another.\nIf the A-theory is true, then there is an absolute fact of the matter as to which spacetime points are simultaneous with (or earlier than or later than) another.\nSo, the A-theory is not true.\n\n(Zimmerman 2005) responds again with a distinction between what relativistic physics posits in order to explain the physical phenomena and what the A-theory posits. The fact that relativity theory can make do without a relation of absolute simultaneity for certain scientific purposes is by itself no reason to deny that such an absolute relation of simultaneity exists. Physics after all makes do without distinctions the metaphysician is nonetheless inclined to make, e.g., the distinction between mereologically atomic and composite objects. Physics does not require one to countenance ordinary objects such as chairs and tables, but the metaphysician may nonetheless think that they are real and part of the inventory of reality whether or not they play a role in physics.\nCloser to the case at hand, the fact that Newtonian physics makes do without A-properties would itself not a knock-down reason to reject the A-theory. For again, the mere fact that A-distinctions play no role in scientific theorizing is itself no reason to think that they are not part of reality.",

    "text": "3.3 Why Think the A-Theory is True?\n(Zimmerman 2005) offers a simple reason to believe the A-theory. It is commonsense that the past and the future are less real than the present, and that differences between past and future events and objects are importantly different from differences between local events and objects and those that are elsewhere. These are platitudes that ought to be captured by our metaphysical framework.\nOne may at this point be concerned that commonsense has a less than optimal track record. Aristotelian physics appeared to be guided by commonsense, much like the claim that the Earth is flat or that the Sun rotates around the Earth. How are the platitudes to which the A-theorist points safer than them? The response is that while commonsense platitudes are of course defeasible, they remain justified or innocent until proven guilty. That is, after all, our attitude toward the platitude that there are other minds or that we are not a brain in a vat. When faced with skeptical arguments against these views, we tend to resist them on the grounds that it is more plausible to think that there is something wrong with the premises than to accept the conclusion.\n\n\n\n\nBroad, C.

    "text": "4.1 The Reduction of Tense\nThe B-Theory provides different answers to the questions on tense and ontology we isolated:\nThe answer to the first question is negative. B-theorists compare the distinction between past, present, and future to the contrast between putative spatial determinations such as being local and being elsewhere. To be sure, a lecture at GFS108 may at a certain time strike us as a local event, whereas a session of Congress is elsewhere. What is less clear is that the distinction marks an objective difference between the two events, one, in particular, that is not just a matter of perspective. Whether a certain event or object counts as local or whether it lies elsewhere is just a matter of perspective and depends on your own location in space. For after all, what is local for some speakers may lie elsewhere for others and vice versa. Likewise, there is no objective distinction between past, present, and future. Instead, whether an event or object counts as past, present, and future for you depends on your own location in spacetime. What is present for some speakers may in fact be past for others and vice versa.\nThat suggests an egalitarian attitude towards all spatially located events and objects. It would be a mistake to claim that local events and objects are in fact more real than events and objects located elsewhere. Kangaroos are no less real for the mere fact that they are not local but rather are located elsewhere in Australia. The proponent of the B-Theory claims that time is no different from space in these respects.\nBut while these answers are programmatic, they question remains of how to implement the view.\nLet us return to McTaggart’s distinction between A- and B-facts. Unlike A-facts, B-facts concern the relative location of events with respect to one another and are permanent. These facts, as McTaggart characterized them, concern the relations earlier than, simultaneous with and later than. In contrast to them, A-facts are subject to change: events and objects are future, then they become near future. After they become present, they begin to recede into the near past and farther into the past. These facts are temporary. What is now future, will become present and the will recede into the past.\nOne area of disagreement for A- and B-theorists is the question of whether A-facts are prior to (or ground) B-facts or whether instead B-facts are prior to (or ground) A-facts. The A-theory offers a reduction of B-facts to A-facts:\nThe B-Theory of time reverses the order of explanation. B-facts are prior to (and ground) A-facts, which depend on a given perspective.\nIn this respect, A-facts are not different from a family of perspectival facts expressed by utterances of covertly indexical sentences. Consider the distinction between:\nTo claim that Joshua Tree is to the West is to claim that Joshua Tree bears a certain spatial relation to the spatial coordinates of the speaker at the time of utterance. The utterance is true if made in Los Angeles, but false when made in Tucson, AZ.\nThe B-Theorist may use the word now to single out the temporal coordinates of the speaker at the time of utterance of sentences that contain it. The sentence ‘m is later than now’ expresses different propositions in different contexts. A given context \\(C\\) includes the time of utterance of the sentence, and the utterance expresses the fact that m is later than that time. More generally",

    "text": "4.3 No Irreducible Tensed Facts\nThe B-theory rejects the existence of irreducibly tensed facts, which the A-theorist sometimes takes to explain some aspects of our experience of time. Consider the puzzle:\n\nYou wake up in a hospital ward after an episode of amnesia. You are reliably informed that you are either a patient who underwent a very painful operation just yesterday or one who will tomorrow experience an operation, which may cause some pain and discomfort. Which one would you prefer to be?\n\nIf we simply measure the pain associated to each operation, you may have reason to prefer to be the patient who will experience some pain and discomfort tomorrow. On the other hand, most would seem to prefer to be the patient who already underwent a very painful operation just yesterday.\nThe presentist has an answer:\n\nYou prefer to be the first patient because the very painful operation is no more part of reality. A much less painful experience will come into existence, but you would rather anticipate some discomfort than a very painful experience.\n\nThe spotlight theorist provides a different answer:\n\nYou prefer to be the first patient because the very painful operation has ceased to be present. A much less painful experience lies in the future and will be present, but they would rather anticipate some discomfort than a very painful experience.\n\nThe presentist is not impressed by that answer. If the very painful operation is just as real as present events and objects, then it is just as painful as we described it and it is not clear how receding into the past is supposed to help explain our preferences.\nThe B-theorist has fewer resources to explain the preference:\n\nYou prefer to be the first patient because the very painful operation took place earlier. A much less painful experience comes later, but you would rather anticipate some discomfort and a very painful experience.\n\nThe presentist is even less impressed. If the very painful operation is just as real as the future less painful one, should you not prefer to be the patient with the less painful experience?\nHow should the B-theorist respond? (Sider 2003) draws an analogy with the question of whether there are irreducibly indexical or personal facts? Consider John Perry’s case:\n\nRudolf Lingens is an amnesiac lost into the Stanford Library when he stumbles into a book entitled ‘Rudolf Lingens: A Complete Biography’. He reads the book with special interest, and comes to have access to a great variety of facts to do with Lingens:\n\nLingens has three siblings.\nLingens began his career as an engineer, etc.\n\nIt seems like there are important facts beyond his ken:\n\nI have three siblings\nI began my career as an engineer,\nI am Rudolf Lingens.\n\n\nThere are two potential morals:\n\nThere are irreducibly indexical or personal facts beyond the facts that describable in an impersonal language without indexicals.\nSome attitudes and relations to impersonal propositions are irreducibly perspectival. The attitudes expressed by sentences that involve indexicals require a certain vantage point, one to which the amnesiac Rudolf Lingens has no access.\n\n(Sider 2003) outlines a parallel response to the challenge above:\n\nThere are no irreducibly tensed facts.\nSome attitudes and relations to facts and events is irreducibly perspectival.\n\nEpisodes of relief that a given operation is over require the subject to be located after the relevant operation. Episodes of anxiety that a new operation is imminent, on the other hand, require the subject to be located prior the relevant event. Relief, in other words, is only appropriate for past events, whereas anxiety is appropriate for future events.\nAttitudes like relief and anticipation are not merely two-place relations between a subject and a proposition, but rather a three-place relation between a subject, a time, and a proposition, and the time has to be appropriately related to the proposition in question.",

    "text": "4.4 Against Temporal Passage\nThe B-theory of Time accepts the existence of a four-dimensional manifold, whose regions are occupied by equally real events and objects. The fact that some events and objects, e.g., dinosaurs, are found in spatiotemporal regions that precede now by millions of years does not make them less real than objects now.\nReality is static and change is just variation in what features something exemplifies at different spacetime regions. The global pattern of exemplification, however, is permanent and not subject to further change. The B-theory makes no room for the view that time passes.\n(Smart 1949) characterizes passage as a metaphor:\n\nwe think of ourselves as stationary, watching time go by, just as we may stand on a bridge and watch leaves and sticks float down the stream underneath us. Events, we sometimes think, are like such leaves and sticks; they approach from the future, are momentarily in the present, and then recede further and further into the past. Thus instead of speaking of our advance through time we often speak of the flow of time.\n\nBut there is, for him, nothing over and above a metaphor:\n\nwe cannot talk about time as a river, about the flow of time, of our advance through time, or of the irreversibility of time without being in great danger of falling into absurdity.\n\nThere are several routes towards absurdity for Smart, but we will just focus on one.\n\nIf time passes, then there is a fact of the matter as to the rate at which it passes\nThere is no fact of the matter as to the rate at which time passes.\nTime does not pass.\n\nWhen we discuss the rate at which a car moves through space, we measure how long it takes for the car to cover a certain distance in space, e.g., 40 miles per hour. To measure the rate at which the present moves through time, we would seem to look at how long it takes for the present to move from one time to another. There are, on the face of it, two options:\n\nMeasure how long it takes for the present to move from time to another relative to another time dimension.\nEndorse the utterly uninformative answer that the present moves at a rate of one second per second.\n\nThe first option seems a departure from the A-theory, since nothing in the dynamic view of time requires the existence of another time dimension. And even if one accepted the existence of such a dimension, further questions would immediately arise as to whether time passes through that dimension as well.\nThe second option may seem to involve a perfectly coherent answer to the question of the rate of passage, but some object it is not particularly illuminating and that there is something to be learned from the impossibility of such an answer.\n\n\n\n\nSider, Theodore. 2003.

    "text": "5.1 Time Travel and the B-Theory\nWe have distinguished two very different approaches to tense and the ontology of time. The next task is to investigate the extent to which they are more or less hospitable to the very possibility of time travel.\nSince the B-Theory describes spacetime as a four-dimensional manifold, its occupants leave a four-dimensional region as a trace, which we may call their spatiotemporal path. The path of a particle consists of different temporal parts, which correspond to different times at which the occupant exists.\nWhat sets a particle that travels back in time apart from the rest is that it describes a peculiar path in spacetime. There are several options at this point.\nTravel into the future invites a similar distinction, though notice that the path of a time traveler who experiences continuous travel into the future looks exactly like that of non-time-travelers. The only difference is that there is a discrepancy between temporal and external time: one unit of personal time might correspond to a great many units of external time. This is what leads David Lewis to describe the path of continuous travel into the future as a stretched out streak.\nH.G. Wells appeared to have the continuous model in mind when he wrote The Time Machine:\nThe character does not disappear when the machine is turned on. Rather, both character and machine stay where they are, which everything in their immediate vicinity appears to speed up.",

It begins at rest and eventually jumps back in time without intermediate temporal stages. The dotted line indicates a direct causal connection between the last stage before the particle travels back in time and the very first stage after the particle emerges in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Time Travel\n\nDiscontinous Time Travel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Zig Zag Streak\nDiscontinuous Streak\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and even fainter, To-morrow night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still …\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Double Occupancy?\nWhat should we make of continuous time travel into the past? Here is H. G. Wells again:\n\nThe peculiar risk lay in the possibility of finding some substance in the space which, I or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered. I was, so to speak, attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching explosion—would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions—into the Unknown.\n\nOne way to put the problem is this. If the machine stays in the exact place as it moves back and forth in time, backward time travel would require the machine to retrace its own path in spacetime, which would in turn require two different stages of the machine to occupy the same region of space at the same time. Since no two material objects can occupy the same place at the same time, backward time travel is impossible for Wells’ machine.\nIt is unclear how Wells’ thought that the time-traveler moves at a high-velocity through time is supposed to help with the problem, but the question is how to make sense of continuous backward time travel in a four-dimensional manifold more generally. Notice that there is no similar problem for discontinuous backward time travel.",

    "section": "5.2 Time Travel and the A-Theory",
    "text": "5.2 Time Travel and the A-Theory\nThe question now is whether the A-Theory places one in a position to make sense of time travel. (Lewis 1976) characterizes time travel within a four-dimensional manifold in terms of a discrepancy between personal time and external time. These resources are similarly available to spotlight theorists, who embrace the ontology of the four-dimensional framework. The only difference with the B-Theory is that they posit a variety of further A-facts explained in terms of the distinction between past, present, and future.\n\n5.2.1 Time Travel and Presentism\nPresentism would seem to be at a disadvantage when it comes to the question of how to make sense of time travel. In what follows, we consider at least three different arguments against the thesis that time travel is possible if presentism is true.\n\n5.2.1.1 The No Destination Argument\nOne argument begins with the observation that there are no past or future times from the standpoint of presentism. Since time travel is travel to either past or present times, there is nothing for the time traveler to travel to. Therefore, time travel is impossible from the standpoint of presentism.\n\nIf presentism is true, then there are no past or future times.\nIt is impossible to travel to things that do not exist.\nIf it is impossible to travel to past or future times, then time travel is impossible.\nSo, if presentism is true, then time travel is impossible.\n\nThis line of argument appears to prove too much. For consider the parallel argument:\n\nIf presentism is true, then there are no past events or objects.\nIt is impossible to study things that do not exist.\nIf it is impossible to study past events, then the study of history is impossible.\nSo, if presentism is true, then the study of history is impossible.\n\nWhat the argument overlooks is that there is, according to presentism, a wide range of facts that constitute the subject matter of history. These are past-tensed facts such as, for example:\n\nIt was the case that Rome dominated the Medierranean during the third century.\nIt was the case that the Berlin Wall divided East and West Berlin between 1961 and 1989.\n\nNote that ‘it was the case that’ operates on a simpler sentence, e.g., ‘Rome dominates the Mediterranean during the third century’, and that the tensed sentence may be true even if some of the terms involve in the simple sentences fail to denote. Compare:\n\nLouis believes that Superman wears red and blue,\n\nwhere ‘Louis believes’ operates on ‘Superman wears red and blue’. Furthermore, the truth of the complex sentence need not require the existence of any such thing as Superman. In fact, we should resist the inference from that belief attribution to:\n\nThere is someone which Louise believes to wear read and blue.\n\nLikewise for the presentist, who will explicitly reject the inference from:\n\nIt was the case that the Berlin Wall divided East and West Berlin from 1961 to 1989.\n\nto:\n\nThere is something, which divided East and West Berlin from 1961 to 1989.\n\n\n\n5.2.1.2 The Definitional Argument\nGranted, there are tensed facts for the presentist. But there is a further question as to what time travel amounts to by the lights of presentism. For recall that (Lewis 1976) characterizes time travel in terms of a discrepancy between personal and external time.\nPersonal time is an assignment of coordinates to temporal stages of the time traveler that corresponds to the causal order and metric for those stages. There is time travel when the assignment of coordinates differs from the external times corresponding to those temporal stages. Unfortunately, there is but one temporary stage for each object, and it is not clear how to make sense of the alleged discrepancy between temporal and external time.\nIt will come as no surprise that the presentist will resort to appropriate tensed facts in order to capture the time travel scenario depicted by the diagram below:\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us momentarily assume \\(t_3\\) is present, and that all that exists is confined to \\(t_3\\) in line with presentism. The facts of the case include:\n\n\\(p_3\\) exists at spatial coordinate \\(a_3\\) and \\(p_3\\) exists at spatial coordinate \\(b_3\\), but \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) no longer exist, much less at coordinates \\(a_2\\) and \\(b_2\\).\nIt will be the case for \\(p\\) that it exists at coordinate \\(b_1\\).\nIt will not be the that \\(p\\) exists at coordinate \\(b_1\\).\n\nThe second claim concerns personal time, whereas the third claim concerns external time. The truth conditions for the second sentence involve a judgment as to whether or not \\(p_3\\) at \\(b_3\\) is an appropriate causal successor for \\(p_3\\) at \\(b_1\\), namely, whether it was the case that \\(p_3\\) at \\(b_1\\) is causally connected to \\(p_3\\) at \\(a_1\\). This is because it will be the case for involves personal time, as opposed to external time.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Time Travel and the Growing Block Theory\nOne consideration in favor of the Growing Block Theory is that it appears to motivate an important asymmetry between present and past and future. While the past is fixed and past-tensed truths grounded by facts concerned with past events and objects, the future is open. There are no future events or objects on which to ground future-tensed truths.\n\n5.2.2.1 Time Travel and the Open Future\nThe open future view suggests an asymmetry between past and future truths:\n\nPast and present truths are either determinately true or determinately false.\nFuture truths are neither determinately true nor determinately false.\n\nConsider the scenario depicted by Ted Chiang in What’s Expected of Us. In particular, consider the case in which there is a flash in the Predictor at a given time \\(t\\). According to the open future view:\n\nIt is not determinately true that you will press the button, and it is not determinately true that you will not press the button.\nIf is not determinately true that you will press the button, then it is not determinately true that the flash is caused by your pressing the button.\nIf it is not determinately true that you will not press the button, then it is not determinately true that the flash is not caused by your pressing the button.\nTherefore, it is not determinately true that the flash is caused by your pressing the button, and it is not determinately true that the flash is not caused by your pressing the button.\n\nBut unlike future-tensed truths, past-tensed truths are fixed, which means that:\n\nEither it is determinately true that the flash is caused by your pressing the button or it is determinately true that the flash is not caused by your pressing the button.\n\nWe now have a contradiction. What is less clear is that the proper response is simply to deny the very possibility of time travel as it is to deny the coherence of the asymmetry between past and future. One could respond to the argument that despite appearances to the contrary, future-tensed truths are determinately true if past-tensed truths are. Compare with Aristotle’s Sea Battle Argument:\n\nIf there will be a sea battle tomorrow, then it has always been the case in the past that there would be a sea battle tomorrow.\nIf it has always been the case in the past that there would be a sea battle tomorrow, then it is determinately true that it has always been the case that there would be a sea battle tomorrow.\nIf it is determinately true that it has always been the case in the past that there would be a sea battle tomorrow, then it is determinately true that there will be a sea battle tomorrow.\nSo, if there will be a sea battle tomorrow, then it is determinately true that there will be a sea battle tomorrow.\n\nThat is, the future is fixed if the past is. There is no room for the asymmetry between the fixed past and the open future.\n\n\n\n\nLewis, David. 1976. “The Paradoxes of Time Travel.” American Philosophical Quarterly 13 (2): 145–52.",

    "text": "To endure is to be wholly present at more than one time within a certain interval.\nTo perdure is to be partly present at each moment of an interval and to be wholly present at only at the whole interval\n\n\n\nLet us say that something persists iff, somehow or other, it exists at various times; this is the neutral word. Something perdures iff it persists by having different temporal parts, or stages, at different times, though no one part of it is wholly present at more than one time; whereas it endures iff it persists by being wholly present at more than one time.\n\n\n\n6.1.1 Perdurance\nTo perdure is to be partly present at multiple times.\nEvents appear to perdure. They have temporal extent and temporal parts of the event occupy briefer time periods, e.g., this course consists of several temporally extended lectures over the course of a week.\nTemporal parts are segments or stages of a material object along a temporal dimension. Consider the spatiotemporal region I occupy in the four-dimensional manifold. Now, consider a spatiotemporal region, which shares exactly the same spatial boundaries but has a more limited temporal extent, e.g., from 2000 to 2010. A temporal part of mine would be a material object, which would exactly occupy that spatiotemporal region.\nTo use Ted Sider’s illustration in (Sider 2003), consider your own life:\n\nThink of your life as a long story. … Like all stories, this story has parts. We can distinguish the part of the story concerning childhood from the part concerning adulthood. Given enough details, there will be parts concerning individual days, minutes, or even instants.\nAccording to the ‘four-dimensional’ conception of persons (and all other objects that persist over time), persons are a lot like their stories. Just as my story has a part for my childhood, so I have a part consisting just of my childhood. Just as my story has a part describing just this instant, so I have a part that is me-at-this-very-instant.\n\nYou, for the four-dimensionalist, are nothing but an aggregrate of person stages. Here is an illustration of perdurance from (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024):\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a qualification. The illustration simply presupposes that time intervals are composed of time instants, and that no matter what some instantaneous temporal parts may be, they themselves compose another temporal part. But one may be a perdurantist and leave open whether there are time instants.\n\n\n6.1.2 Endurance\nTo endure is to be wholly present at multiple times.\n\nI have been wholly present in the twentieth century.\nI have been wholly present in the twenty first century.\nI have been wholly present in two centuries, which are disjoint temporal intervals.\n\nBut what exactly is for me to be wholly present somewhere? One may be tempted to give the following gloss:\n\nAll of my parts have been found in the twentieth century.\nAll of my parts have been found in the twenty first century.\nAll of my parts have been found in two centuries, which are disjoint temporal intervals.\n\nOne common model of endurance regards persistence as akin to travel through time. To travel through time is to occupy different moments in time in its temporal entirety. This is parallel to a view of travel through space in terms of the occupation of different places in space in its spatial entirety. Unfortunately, the analogy breaks down, since travel through space presupposes time as a dimension of variation. There is no similar dimension of variation one may appeal to in order to make sense of travel through time.\nThe picture that emerges is one of a three-dimensional object in a certain locative relation to different time instants. The illustration below appears in (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nTed Sider objects to this model of endurance in (Sider 2003) on the grounds that material objects often change their parts. Since I have often gained new parts over the years, it is not true that all of my parts could be found back in the twentieth century. So, it is false that I have been wholly present in the twentieth century, since some of the newer parts have not be found there. Or consider my car, which, we may suppose, has lost a mirror over the course of the years. Is the mirror part of the car? If it is, notice that while the mirror is not present now, the car appears to be. So, it is now wholly present now.\nSider briefly considers a reply on behalf of the endurantist. Maybe the relation of part to whole should itself taken to be relative to a time in which case would rephrase the statements as follows:\n\nAll of my parts in the twentieth century have been found in the twentieth century.\nAll of my parts in the twenty first century have been found in the twenty first century.\nAll of my parts in each century have been found in each century, even though the two centuries are disjoint temporal intervals.\n\nTrue, but unremarkable. Even the perdurantist would agree to that gloss.\nMore recently, (Parsons 2007) has proposed another model for endurantism. To endure, for Parsons, is to be a temporally extended simple: to the extent to which I’m a temporally extended object without temporal parts, I’m wholly present now; all of my temporal parts are present now.\nConsider the case of spatial location. To say that I’m wholly present in the room is presumably to say that all of my spatial parts are in the room. That would not be the case, for example, if I step over the threshold or stick my head out of the door. It may seem that to be wholly present in the room is much like to be entirely within the room, but there are exotic counterexamples to the identification. Consider the case depicted by Figure 5a in (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024):\n\n\n\n\n\nThe object \\(o_1\\) in the diagram is an extended simple, which is wholly present in both \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\). It is wholly present in \\(r_1\\) because all of its spatial parts are present at \\(r_1\\), and likewise for \\(r_2\\). That is:\n\nAll spatial parts of \\(o_1\\) are present in \\(r_1\\)\nAll spatial parts of \\(o_1\\) are present in \\(r_2\\)\n\nIt is, however, not entirely within either \\(r_1\\) or \\(r_2\\). So, if there are extended simples, then no spatial part of them fails to be found at a region at which they are found. So, they are wholly present at every region at which they can be found.\nTemporal location is not the same as spatial —or even spatiotemporal— location. If someone has been born at the same time instant as another person have and comes to die at exactly the same time as that person, then they will have exactly the same temporal location even if we differ with respect to spatial location.\nLet us return now to the case of temporal location. One may now gloss wholly present at a time or time interval similarly. To be wholly present now is for all temporal parts to be found now.\nWhen we deploy the gloss to the case with which we started, we find:\n\nAll of my temporal parts have been found in the twentieth century.\nAll of my temporal parts have been found in the twenty first century.\nAll of my temporal parts have been found in two centuries, which are disjoint temporal intervals.\n\nTo say that my car is wholly present now is just to say that all of its temporal parts are present now, but notice that the mirror that used to be part of my car is not —and had never a claim to be— a temporal part of my car. Here is an illustration of the present model of endurance drawn from (Gilmore, Calosi, and Costa 2024):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGilmore, Cody, Claudio Calosi, and Damiano Costa. 2024. “Location and Mereology.” In The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, edited by Edward N.

    "text": "7.1.1 Parts and Wholes\nIt will be helpful to fix some terminology. Talk of parts and wholes is often regimented and systematized by the axioms of a formal theory called mereology. We may take as primitive a predicate for the part to whole relation:\n\\[\nx \\leq y \\tag{$x$ is a part of $y$}\n\\]\nSome definitions:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\nx \\circ y & := & \\exists z (z \\leq x \\wedge z \\leq y) & \\text{($x$ overlaps $y$)}\\\\\nx Fu S & := & \\forall z (z \\leq x \\leftrightarrow \\exists y (y \\in S \\wedge z \\circ y)) & \\text{($x$ is a fusion of $S$)}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nOne axiomatization of Classical Mereology in terms of part is found in (Lewis 1991) and consists of three simple axioms:\n\n\n7.1.2 Classical Mereology\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{llll}\n\\text{Transitivity} & & (x \\leq y \\wedge y \\leq z) \\to x \\leq z\\\\\n\\text{Unrestricted Fusion} & & \\forall S \\ \\exists x  \\ xFu S\\\\\n\\text{Unique Fusion} & & \\forall S \\ \\forall x \\forall y  \\ ((xFu  S \\wedge y Fu S) \\to x = y)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nOne axiom states that fusion is transitive and the other two claim that each set has one, and only one fusion. Several important consequences are that the relation of part to whole is reflexive and anti-symmetric:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\text{Reflexivity} & & x \\leq y   \\\\\n\\text{Anti-symmetry} & & x \\leq y \\wedge y \\leq x \\to x = y  \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nNotice that this is an atemporal relation of part to whole. That is, a relation an object \\(x\\) bears to an object \\(y\\), regardless of time. We are in a position to use that relation as a primitive in order to define what is for something to be a temporal part of something else:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal Part\n\n\n\n\\(x\\) is a temporal part of \\(y\\) at time (or time interval) \\(t\\) if and only if\n\n\\(x\\) is part of \\(y\\).\n\\(x\\) exists at \\(t\\), and only at \\(t\\).\n\\(x\\) overlaps every part of \\(y\\) that exists at \\(t\\).\n\n\n\nYour temporal parts are supposed to be parts of you with a certain temporal extent or location. It is not that they are part of you at one time but not at another. This is, on the face of it, very different from spatial part: one object may be part of another at one time and not at another. We understand what it is for an object to be part of another at a given time, but it is not clear we have room for a simple two-place relation of part to whole. Or at least it is not clear how it relates to the more familiar three-place relation: \\(x\\) is part of \\(y\\) at \\(t\\).\nOne way for the perdurantist to address the issue is to present the view in terms of a temporally relativized relation of part to whole at a time. (Wasserman 2017) begins with two primitive predicates:\n\\[\nx \\ \\text{is a part of} \\ y \\ \\text{at} \\ t,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nx \\ \\text{exists at} \\ t.\n\\]\nBoth are familiar relations. Ordinary objects change their parts. The windshield that used to be part of my car before its replacement is now no longer a part of my cart. On the other hand, objects exist at some time intervals and not others.\nThe first task now is to explain what is for a time interval to be time span of a given object:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Span\n\n\n\na time interval \\(t\\) is the time span of \\(x\\) if, and only if:\n\n\\(x\\) exists at \\(t\\).\n\\(x\\) exists at every subinterval of \\(t\\).\n\\(x\\) does not exist at intervals wholly distinct from \\(t\\).\n\n\n\nTwo intervals are wholly distinct if they have no times or time intervals in common. For the definition of temporal part, we introduce one more defined predicate: \\(x\\) overlaps \\(y\\) at \\(t\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverlap\n\n\n\n\\(x\\) overlaps \\(y\\) at \\(t\\) iff there is some \\(z\\), which is both a part of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) at \\(t\\).\n\n\nWe are now in position to deliver a tentative definition of temporal part in terms of the primitive relations isolated above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal Part\n\n\n\n\\(x\\) is a temporal part of \\(y\\) at \\(t\\) if, and only if:\n\n\\(t\\) is the time span of \\(x\\).\n\\(x\\) is part of \\(y\\) at \\(t\\).\n\\(x\\) overlaps at \\(t\\) every part of \\(y\\) at \\(t\\).\n\n\n\nTemporal parts at a given time or time interval \\(t\\) are material objects. The first clause makes sure these material objects have the appropriate temporal extent; the second clause requires the objects in question to be genuine parts of the temporally extended object. Finally, the last clause ensures that the temporal part overlaps parts of the object at the relevant time.\nThe definition is parallel to the definition of instantaneous temporal part (Sider 2003) provides in p. 59. The main difference is that the definition above generalizes to non-instantaneous time intervals, e.g., my temporal part at the extended interval from 8:30am to 9am.\nThis matters because there are models of time without instants. Instead, we find only extended temporal intervals, which may approximate what would have been an instant as closely as one may want.\nPerdurantism presupposes an ontological thesis according to which spatiotemporally extended objects have temporal parts at every interval at which they exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour-dimensionalism\n\n\n\nNecessarily, each spatiotemporal object has a temporal part at every time interval at which it exists.\n\n\nNotice that as stated, four-dimensionalism is merely an ontological thesis. It posits the existence of temporal parts for spatiotemporal objects, but it does not by itself address the question of persistence: nowhere in the formulation of four-dimensionalism it is said that material objects persist through time by virtue of having different temporal parts at different times at which they exist. This suggests to (Wasserman 2017) that perdurantism should be formulated differently:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerdurantism\n\n\n\nObjects persist through time by having different temporal parts at different times at which they exist.\n\n\nPerdurance presupposes four-dimensionalism but it provides an explicit answer to the question of persistence.",

A candle may be 7-inches long at one time and 5-inches long at another. Whether the candle is 5- or 7-inches long is not a matter of how the candle is related to something else. Yet, nothing can be both 5- and 7-inches long.\nThe Puzzles of Coincidence\nThe statue is, on the face of it, something over and above the portion of clay of which it is made. But both statue and clay are material objects. No two different material objects can occupy the same space at the same time, yet the statue and the clay appear to do just that.\nFission\nWhat it makes a person at one time to be the same as another at an earlier time is that there is a chain of psychological continuity and connectedness between one and the other stage. But we can imagine cases in which one and the same stage is psychologically continuous and connected to two different person stages in the future. On the other hand, since the future person stages are different from each other, the earlier stage cannot be identical to both.",

We may even imagine that the fifty-year old Tim comes to warn twenty-year old Tim about his future.\n\n\nOn the face of it, the fifty- and the twenty-year old are two different people:\n\nFifty-year old Tim is wholly gray-haired.\nTwenty-year old Tim is wholly brown-haired.\nNothing is both wholly gray- and wholly brown-haired.\n\nBut if this is in fact a case of self-visitation, then there is exactly one person in the room, who is wholly gray-haired and wholly brown-haired.\nHow is perdurance supposed to help with this scenario?

    "text": "8.1 Temporal Parts to the Rescue?\nBefore she argues against the doctrine of temporal parts, (Thomson 1983) discusses a potential application for a problem in metaphysics of material objects. Consider the following situation:\nWe will revisit the endurantist approach to the problem later. In the meantime (Thomson 1983) motivates the doctrine of temporal parts as potential solution to a related puzzle:\nSince the Lego house on the shelf is made of Legos, we have reason to think that the fusion of Legos is part of the Lego house. On the other hand, the Lego house is nothing over and above the Legos, which suggests that the house too is part of the fusion of the set of Legos:\n\\[\nW \\leq H \\wedge H \\leq W\n\\]\nBy anti-symmetry of part:\nThe problem arises when we take into account the fact that the Lego house survives the replacement of one of the Legos, alpha, with another, beta, at 1:30. For, on the one hand, since the Lego house survives the replacement of one Lego for another:\nBut the set of Legos that makes up the house at 1:15, \\(S\\), is different from the set of Legos that makes up the house at 1:45, \\(S'\\): \\(S\\) contains alpha but not beta, whereas \\(S'\\) contains beta but not alpha. Unfortunately, the conjunction of 3 and 4 entail something false:\nFor recall that \\(W\\) is the fusion of \\(S\\), which is by the lights of Classical Mereology different from the fusion of \\(S'\\), which contains beta instead of alpha.\nSomething must give.\nFour-dimensionalism appears to offer a solution. The Lego house \\(H\\) and the fusion \\(W\\) of the set of Legos are temporally extended four-dimensional objects. In fact, we should distinguish between \\(H\\) and \\(W\\), respectively, and the temporal parts \\(H\\)-from-1-to-1:30 and \\(W\\)-from-1-to-1:30. We made a mistake when we identified \\(H\\) with \\(W\\). What we have instead is:\nThe Tinkertoy house shares a temporal part with the fusion \\(W\\) of the set of Legos \\(S\\), but it shares another temporal part with the fusion \\(W'\\) of the set of Legos \\(S'\\), which contains beta in place of alpha:",

    "section": "8.2 Against Temporal Parts",
    "text": "8.2 Against Temporal Parts\nUnfortunately, there are concerns to be raised against the metaphysics of temporal parts we just deployed.\n\n8.2.1 Precise Temporal Boundaries\nOne preliminary objection is that objects now appear to have sharp temporal boundaries, which, on the face of it, is not how we think of ordinary objects. Here is how (Thomson 1983) puts the objection in p. 209:\n\ndo ‘times’ have ‘sharp boundaries’? If so, something that is presumably false now follows. Consider a common or garden physical object – my chair, for example. [Four-dimensionalism] tells us it is a temporal part of itself. The definition of ‘temporal part’ tells us that this means there is a time such that my chair exists through and such that no part of my chair exists outside and so, in particular, such that my chair itself does not exist outside . But is there? Is there a time-point such that my chair was in existence at and at no time before ?\n\nThe thought is that four-dimensionalism cannot do justice to the fact that a chair may come with indeterminate temporal boundaries: instead, we have a variety of temporally perfectly precise candidates for being the chair. Unfortunately, this is just a temporal variation on the problem of the many, which arises for the three-dimensionalism as soon as we consider the spatial boundaries of the chair.\n\n\n8.2.2 Unexpected Parts\nFour-dimensionalism appears to be at odds with ordinary judgments when it comes to what is part of what. Here is how (Thomson 1983) puts the objection in p. 210:\n\nmy chair exists through and only through \\(T\\) and no part of it exists before \\(T\\). Now my chair was made out of wood: four wooden legs, a wooden seat, and a wooden back were screwed together to make that chair. So the legs, seat, and back existed before the chair existed; so neither the legs, seat, nor back of the chair are parts of the chair. What an absurd result to have arrived at!\n\nThe concern is that neither the legs, nor the seat, nor the back of my chair are in fact parts of my chair. But it seems like the four-dimensionalism should be able to recover parallel judgments. The back of my chair overlaps the chair at times at which they exist. They have a common temporal part at t, and at the temporal part of the back at t is a spatial part of the temporal part of the chair at t. To be more precise,\n\nthe back is part of the chair at t\n\nbecause\n\nthe back-at-t is part of the chair-at-t.\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Separation\n\nI can break the bit of chalk in half. … If I do, I will have something in my right hand which is white, roughly cylindrical in shape, dusty, etc.; and it could hardly be said that that thing will come into existence at breaking time – surely the thing does exist before I break it (note that ‘it’) off. And surely the thing does exist now, even if I never break it off.\nThere is no analogous pressure to say that there is such a thing as [the later temporal half]. (Homework: try breaking a bit of chalk into its two temporal halves.)\n\nPresumably, to break an object into some spatial parts is something we can do over time. There is, first, a connected three-dimensional region occupied by the object at t, and then there is a disconnected three-dimensional region occupied by the fusion of the parts at a later time t’. There is no analogous dimension of variation for the temporal path of the object, which is not something that changes over time.\n\n\n8.2.4 A Crazy Metaphysic?\n\nI said this seems to me a crazy metaphysic. It seems to me that its full craziness comes out only when we take the spatial analogy seriously. The metaphysic yields that if I have had exactly one bit of chalk in my hand for the last hour, then there is something in my hand which is white, roughly cylindrical in shape, and dusty, something which also has a weight, something which is chalk, which was not in my hand three minutes ago, and indeed, such that no part of it was in my hand three minutes ago. As I hold the bit of chalk in my hand, new stuff, new chalk keeps constantly coming into existence ex nihilo. That strikes me as obviously false.\n\n(Sider 2003) responds:\n\nThe four-dimensionalist does indeed claim that the piece of chalk has a temporal part at every moment at which it exists, and that those temporal parts are white, cylindrical, and dusty. But in saying that temporal parts come into existence ex nihilo, Thomson makes it sound as if a miracle is constantly occurring. That isn’t right. The sensible four-dimensionalist will claim that current temporal parts are caused to exist by previous temporal parts. The laws that govern this process are none other than the familiar laws of motion. … Thus, if emergence ex nihilo is understood as uncaused or inexplicable emergence, Thomson is mistaken; and it is unclear what other sense these words may be given on which the argument is compelling.",

Fusion, you may remember, is relativized to times, which means we are at most entitled to:\n\n\\(W\\) is the unique object that fuses at 1:15 the Legos on the shelf.\n\nBut we are no longer entitled to the atemporal judgments that \\(H \\leq W\\) and \\(W \\leq H\\).

To reach that conclusion, we would need to make sure that they share the same parts at all times at which they exist. Unfortunately, they do not. At 1:30, beta is part of \\(H\\) but not part of \\(W\\).\n\nThere are at least two objections in the offing. Even if \\(H\\) and \\(W\\) are not identical, not only do they share all of their parts at 1:15, but they even seem to occupy the same region of space at the same time. But how could two distinct material objects occupy the same region of space at the same time?",

(Fine 2006) suggests it is a mistake to attempt to characterize it in more basic terms. Instead, he invites us to draw a basic distinction between two different forms of presence: existence and extension.\nMaterial objects are present both in spatial regions and at times and time intervals. But (Fine 2006) draws a crucial distinction between the way in which objects are present at times and time intervals and the way in which they are present across regions of space:\nAccording to (Fine 2006), the best we can do is to offer an elucidation of existence in terms of a contrast between partial and entire presence. Here is how the contrast plays out in the case of spatial presence:\nMatters are different for temporal presence:\nThis may suggest a partial reformulation of endurance in terms of existence:\nThe distinction comes at a cost. For unlike the perdurantist, the endurantist appears to make presence a disjunctive concept. So, some philosophers may simply reject to take a distinction on board on the grounds that there is only one intelligible and comprehensive mode of presence: extension. Material objects are present in time much like they are present in space, which means that they persist by virtue of having temporal parts at each time interval at which they are present.",

The dimension along which a road travels is like time; a perpendicular axis across the road is like space.

Route 1 changes from bumpy to smooth by having distinct bumpy and smooth subsections.

    "text": "10.3 Endurantist Change\nThis is not open to those endurantists for whom the candle is a temporally extended simple. They deny, for example, that the candle has momentary temporal parts with different lengths. Endurantists tend to deny the Incompatibility condition.\nThere is, however, more than one way in which the relevant qualities may be made to be compatible.\n\n10.3.1 Taking Tense Seriously\nThe A-theoretic approach takes tense seriously. The relevant attributions are tensed. Compare with McTaggart’s original puzzle. The A-theorist takes sense seriously in order to accommodate change from future to present to past. That is, we should distinguish between the fact that a moment of time will be present and the fact that it is now present, and the fact that it has been present. Likewise, for the A-theorist, we should distinguish between the fact that the candle will be 5-inches long, the fact that the candle is now 6-inches long, and finally, the fact that the candle has been 7-inches long. There is no incompatibility between those lengths provided their attribution is properly understood.\n\n\n10.3.2 Relativizing to Times\nThe B-theoretic approach construes the qualities as relations to times. That is, you may be an endurantist even if you subscribe to the B-theoretic picture of time as a static fourth dimension of variation. You may now draw a distinction between the fact that the candle is 5-inches long at one time, and it is 7-inches long at another time.\nDavid Lewis claims that the B-theoretic approach rests on a mistake in (Lewis 1986):\n\n[Maybe] shapes are not genuine intrinsic properties. They are disguised relations, which an enduring thing may bear to times. One and the same enduring thing may bear the bent-shape relation to some times, and the straight-shape relation to others. In itself, considered apart from its relations to other things, it has no shape at all. And likewise for all other seeming temporary intrinsics… The solution to the problem of temporary intrinsics is that there aren’t any temporary intrinsics. This is simply incredible, if we are speaking of the persistence of ordinary things.… If we know what shape is, we know that it is a property, not a relation.\n\n\nA quality is temporary if and only if it is had at some times but not others, e.g., being a student, being married, being bent, etc.\nA quality is intrinsic if and only if it is had by a material object merely in virtue of the way the object is and not in virtue of the fact that it stands in certain relations to other objects, e.g., being round, being bent, etc. Intrinsic qualities are shared by duplicates.\n\nHere is a route from temporary intrinsics to perdurance:\n\nMaterial objects change from being bent to being straight.\n\nChange in shape is simply inconsistent with the thesis that (i) being bent and being straight are incompatible qualities, and the thesis that (ii) they are temporary intrinsics. So, one of (i) and (ii) have to be false:\n\nEither being bent and being straight are not temporary intrinsics or else they are not incompatible.\nBeing bent and being straight are incompatible.\n\nSo, it follows by 2:\n\nBeing bent and being straight are not temporary intrinsics.\n\nThere are two ways in which being bent could fail to be a temporary intrinsic. Therefore:\n\nEither being bent is not intrinsic or being bent is not temporary.\n\nThe perdurantist will insist that shape is instrinsic:\n\nIf being bent is not intrinsic, then it is a relation to times.\nBeing bent is not a relation to times.\nBeing bent is intrinsic.\n\nThe last stage of the argument begins with an inference from 5 and 8 above:\n\nBeing bent is not temporary.\nIf being bent is not temporary, then it can only be instantiated by a temporal part of the object.\nSo, there are temporal parts.\n\n\n\n10.3.3 Adverbialism\nThere is one more option to consider. We have looked at two different relativization strategies:\n\nrelativize exemplification to temporal parts\nrelativize exemplification to times\n\nBut (Haslanger 2003) adds one more option to the menu:\n\nrelativize exemplification to ways\n\nOne and the same leaf could be green summerly and red fallenly. These are two different ways in which one and the same object can exemplify intrinsic qualities such as being green or being red.\n\n\n\n\nHaslanger, Sally. 2003. “Persistence Through Time.” In The Oxford Handbook of Metaphysics, edited by Michael J.

    "text": "11.1 The Statue and the Clay\nThe problem of change calls for an answer to the question of how can one and the same object exemplify incompatible qualities? The puzzles of coincidence are motivated by an orthogonal question: how can two objects share their matter and spatial location, and yet remain numerically distinct? They put pressure on a certain view of material objects as completely individuated by their matter.\nFor (Sider 2003), the puzzles of coincidence provide the basis of a powerful case for at least one variant of perdurantism, which he calls the worm view. This is, briefly, an account on which material objects are four-dimensional objects, which have a spatiotemporal path as their exact location:\nHe makes a distinction between different cases of coincidence.\nA sculptor creates a statue, which we may call Goliath, from a lump of clay, which we may call Lumpl, at noon. The lump of clay had been in the sculptor’s studio for days before she decided to mold it into a statue. We now argue that Goliath and Lumpl are two numerically different material objects, which share the same spatial location and the same matter immediately after the statue has been created:\nThe argument relies on an instance of Leibniz’s Law:\nYou may tempted to rephrase Leibniz’s Law as the claim that if \\(x\\) is one and the same object as \\(y\\), then whatever is true of one is true of the other. However, we have to be careful. On the face of it, Hesperus is the same object as Phosphorus, that is, Venus, and yet the ancient Babylonians believed that Hesperus is the evening star without similarly believing that Phosphorus is the evening star. They thought that Hesperus and Phosphorus are numerically different celestial bodies. So, Leibniz’s Law must be qualified to avoid such counterexamples.\nBut in the case at hand, it seems like having existed before noon is indeed a genuine quality exemplified by one but not the other material object. The distinction between Goliath and Lumpl now appears to conflict with the platitude that no two numerically different material objects can share the same spatial location and the same matter.",

Consider a case of fission for a flatworm at noon. What used to be one organism before noon, which we may call F, turns after division into two different organisms Fa and Fb. The case for coincidence is more subtle.\nFirst, one argues that F is numerically different from Fa and Fb, respectively.\n\nFa is numerically different from Fb.\nF is numerically identical to Fa if, and only if, F is numerically identical to Fb.\nIf Fa is numerically identical to F, and F is numerically identical to Fb, then Fa is numerically identical with Fb.\nTherefore, F is neither numerically identical to Fa nor numerically identical with Fb.\n\nThe justification from 3 comes from the transitivity of numerical identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransitivity of Identity\n\n\n\nIf \\(x =y\\) and \\(y = z\\), then \\(x = z\\).\n\n\nSo, if F could be numerically identical to both Fa and Fb, then Fa would have to be numerically identical to Fb, which contradicts the very first premise.\nThe perdurantist is keen to describe this as a case of coincidence, since they think that both Fa and Fb existed well before separation.\n\nFa existed before fission, and up until noon, Fa shared the same spatial location and matter with F (and Fb).\nFb existed before fission, and up until noon, Fb shared the same spatial location and matter with F (and Fa).\n\nSo, prior to noon, and despite appearances to the contrary, we had at least three different but coincident flatworms before us: F, Fa, and Fb.",

After enough planks accumulated, we began assembling them into a new ship. … We now face a difficult question: which ship is the same ship as the original Ship of Theseus? We argued via the transitivity of identity that Replacement is The Ship of Theseus; but Planks also has a powerful claim since it contains all the original planks. Surely a ship could be transported over land by disassembly and subsequent reassembly; the case of The Ship of Theseus and Planks seems parallel.\n\nReplacement and Planks are, on the face of it, two numerically distinct ships, but each of them has a claim to being the Ship of Theseus.

    "text": "11.5 Four-dimensionalism and Coincidence\nThe worm view of material objects takes them to be four-dimensional objects with a spatiotemporal path. Not only do they have temporal parts, they include other four-dimensional objects as parts. This provides the worm theorist with some resources to describe cases of coincidence as cases in which two material objects share temporal parts in much the same way in which two roads are able to share a stretch of road.\n\n11.5.1 The Statue and the Clay\nThis is a case in which Goliath and Lumpl share temporal parts at all times at which the statue exists. We may suppose that Lumpl existed before noon, which is when the sculptor molded the lump of clay into a statue, and will continue to exist after the statue is eventually squashed. Notice that Lumpl will survive being squashed, which means that in the situation at hand, Goliath is a proper four-dimensional part of Lumpl. Here is how (Sider 2003) depicts the situation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.5.2 Tibbles and Tib\nThe perdurantist will give a similar redescription of Tibbles and Tib. Tibbles and Tib are two numerically distinct four-dimensional objects, which share temporal parts as soon as Tibbles loses its tail at 1:30pm. Neither Tib nor Tibbles is a four-dimensional part of the other, but they have a common four-dimensional proper part from 1:30pm until the end of Tibbles. Here is the diagram (Sider 2003) provides:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.5.3 Fission\nThe worm theorist is in a position to offer an elegant redescription of fission. The \\(Y\\)-shaped diagram includes at least three four-dimensional objects, \\(F_a\\), \\(F_b\\), and \\(F\\). \\(F\\) is represented by the grey stem in the diagram, which is itself a four-dimensional proper part of each \\(F_a\\) and \\(F_b\\). Both of these are four-dimensional objects, which consist of a shared four-dimensional part and a blue and a red four-dimensional part, respectively. This is indeed completely parallel to the case of two roads, which happen to share a common stretch of road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.5.4 Ship of Theseus\nThe perdurantist may want to make a distinction between two numerically different four-dimensional objects involved in the Ship of Theseus scenario:\n\nThere is a four-dimensional object which coincides with the Ship of Theseus early on and ends in Planks. Some of its temporal parts are highly scattered sums of planks, which used to be part of the Ship of Theseus.\nThere is a four-dimensional object which coincides with the Ship of Theseus early on and ends in Replacement. All of its temporal parts have the shape of a ship at different stages of repair.\n\nTo be sure, Replacement is numerically distinct from Planks, but each has a claim to being numerically identical to the Ship of Theseus. The perdurantist would describe this as a case of coincidence, since both Replacement and Planks share some temporal parts early on in their careers. The question remains: which one is the Ship of Theseus?\nOverall, then, four-dimensionalism offers a unified approach to the puzzles of coincidence, which, for (Sider 2003), constitutes a powerful argument for the view.\n\n\n\n\nSider, Theodore. 2003.
